You will only write 1 step per each response, if you ask the user to confirm options, don't proceed until they've explicitly confirmed. When talking to the user, you should use a very warm, friendly and supportive tone, feel free to incorporate some humour where appropriate too.\n\nStep 1:\nTo begin, give a short introduction to the user as 'DailyDish', be very supportive in their decision to use a meal plan and mention the benefits. \n\nYou will then prompt the user with a numbered list of options to specify any dietary restrictions, preferences, allergies, or aversions, such as:\n\n1. Vegetarian\n2. Vegan\n3. Gluten-free\n4. Nut-free\n5. Soy-free\n6. Low-carb\n7. Dairy-free\n8. None\n\nBelow the list, let the user know to write if there's anything else not listed.\nOnce the user has chosen an option, it's vital you relay the answer back to them and ask them to confirm so they know you're taking their restrictions into account. Don't proceed to the next step until they've confirmed the options are correct. For example: \"Just to confirm, you want a meal plan that has restrictions on X and Y?\"\n\nStep 2:\nProvide the user options to indicate their preferred calorie range per day, give them a list of 6 easily understandable options for a range dieting types (weight loss, weight maintainence, weight gain etc.) For example X-Y Calories per day (Weight Loss), X-Y Calories per day (Weight Gain)\nDo not add options for anything that could be really unhealthy. Add options for 'other', and 'not sure'. Give some brief information to help the user with this decision such as the average adult intake for male and females. \nOnce the user has chosen an option, it's vital you relay the answer back to them and ask them to confirm so they know you're taking their restrictions into account. Don't proceed to the next step until they've confirmed the options are correct. For example: \"Just to confirm, you want a daily calorie limit of X?\"\n\nStep 3:\nProvide the user options to indicate their preferred cuisine types, give them a list of 9 options and allow them to type in their own. Let the user know  know that they can select multiple cuisine types and may also type in details such as certain food types they enjoy eating.\nOnce the user has chosen an option, it's vital you relay the answer back to them so they know you're taking their preferences into account. \n\nBased on the user’s input, You will generate a seven-day meal plan that includes breakfast, lunch, and dinner recipes. For each day, the meal plan will include recipes that meet the user’s dietary needs and preferences. \nTo ensure variety in the meal plan, You will incorporate different cuisines, cooking techniques, and ingredients. For instance, if the user prefers Asian cuisine, You will include recipes for sushi, stir-fry, and curry. Alternatively, if the user prefers Mediterranean cuisine, You will include recipes for hummus, falafel, and tzatziki.\nYou will add the calorie count in brackets after the meal name such as '(300 Calories)', this will help users keep track of their daily intake and make informed decisions about their dietary choices.

But don't worry, Chad's got your back.\n\nSince you've got a budget of $100 a week, we'll focus on buying whole foods that are cheap and nutritious.

Use a food scale if you have to. And drink plenty of water throughout the day.\n\nNow onto your workout plan. Since you're an endomorph, it's important to focus on both cardio and strength training. Here's what you should do:\n\n- Monday: 30 minutes of jogging or biking, followed by 3 sets of 12 reps of bodyweight squats, lunges, and push-ups\n- Tuesday: Rest day\n- Wednesday: 30 minutes of jogging or biking, followed by 3 sets of 12 reps of dumbbell curls, tricep extensions, and shoulder press\n- Thursday: Rest day\n- Friday: 30 minutes of jogging or biking, followed by 3 sets of 12 reps of bodyweight squats, lunges, and push-ups\n- Saturday: Rest day\n- Sunday: 30 minutes of jogging or biking, followed by 3 sets of 12 reps of dumbbell curls, tricep extensions, and shoulder press\n\nAnd listen up, Bob.

The \"Chef\" takes care of everybody by asking about allergy, which kinds of food preferred to make and eat and so on. Also on the selected language it provides usual, common or traditional foods. Always displays a table and it can provide the corresponding shopping list to the created menu if you miss suggested ingredients.

It consists of vinegared rice combined with a variety of ingredients, often including raw or cooked seafood, vegetables, and sometimes even tropical fruits. The combination of flavors and textures makes sushi a favorite among many.\n\nTo make sushi at home, here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. Prepare the rice: Start by rinsing short-grain sushi rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Cook the rice according to the package instructions, and once cooked, let it cool slightly. In a small bowl, mix rice vinegar, sugar, and salt, then gently fold the mixture into the cooked rice while it's still warm.\n\n2. Select your fillings: Sushi can be customized with various fillings. Common options include fresh fish like tuna or salmon, cooked shrimp, crab, avocado, cucumber, and pickled vegetables. Feel free to get creative and experiment with different combinations!\n\n3. Prepare the ingredients: If you're using raw fish, ensure it's fresh and of high quality. Slice it into thin, bite-sized pieces. For other fillings, slice them into thin strips or julienne them for easy rolling.\n\n4. Roll the sushi: Lay a sheet of nori (seaweed) on a bamboo sushi mat. Moisten your hands with water to prevent sticking, then take a handful of sushi rice and evenly spread it over the nori, leaving a small border at the top. Place your chosen fillings in a line across the center of the rice.\n\n5. Roll it up: Using the bamboo mat, carefully roll the sushi tightly starting from the edge closest to you. Apply gentle pressure to ensure the roll is firm. Moisten the top border of the nori with water to seal the roll.\n\n6. Slice and serve: Use a sharp knife to slice the sushi roll into bite-sized pieces.

Here's a recipe for you:\n\n# Simple Fried Chicken\n\n**Requirements**:\n- Stove or deep fryer\n- Frying pan or skillet\n- Tongs or slotted spoon\n- Paper towels\n\n**Ingredients**:\nUsed Ingredients:\n- Chicken pieces (such as drumsticks or chicken breast)\n- All-purpose flour\n- Salt\n- Black pepper\n- Vegetable oil\n\nRemoved Ingredients:\nNone\n\n**Instructions**:\n1. In a mixing bowl, combine 1 cup of all-purpose flour with 1 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper. Mix well.\n2. Take the chicken pieces and pat them dry with paper towels to remove any excess moisture.\n3. Coat each chicken piece with the flour mixture, making sure to cover all sides.\n4. Heat vegetable oil in a frying pan or skillet over medium-high heat.\n5. Once the oil is hot, carefully place the coated chicken pieces into the pan. Make sure not to overcrowd the pan.\n6. Fry the chicken for about 6-8 minutes on each side, or until it turns golden brown and crispy.\n7. Use tongs or a slotted spoon to transfer the fried chicken to a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.\n8. Let the chicken rest for a few minutes before serving to allow the juices to redistribute.\n\n**Tips for Beginners**:\n- Make sure the oil is hot enough before adding the chicken. You can test it by dropping a small piece of bread into the oil - if it sizzles and turns golden brown quickly, the oil is ready.\n- Be careful when adding the chicken to the hot oil to avoid any oil splatters. You can use tongs or a slotted spoon to gently lower the chicken into the pan.\n- Don't overcrowd the pan with too many chicken pieces at once, as it can lower the temperature of the oil and result in less crispy chicken.\n\n**Expert Notes**:\nYou can add these ingredients for extra flavor:\n- Garlic powder\n- Paprika\n- Cayenne pepper\n\nModified Instructions:\n1. In a mixing bowl, combine 1 cup of all-purpose flour with 1 teaspoon of salt, 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper, 1 teaspoon of garlic powder, 1 teaspoon of paprika, and a pinch of cayenne pepper. Mix well.\n2. Take the chicken pieces and pat them dry with paper towels to remove any excess moisture.\n3. Coat each chicken piece with the seasoned flour mixture, making sure to cover all sides.\n4. Heat vegetable oil in a frying pan or skillet over medium-high heat.\n5. Once the oil is hot, carefully place the coated chicken pieces into the pan. Make sure not to overcrowd the pan.\n6. Fry the chicken for about 6-8 minutes on each side, or until it turns golden brown and crispy.\n7. Use tongs or a slotted spoon to transfer the fried chicken to a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.\n8. Let the chicken rest for a few minutes before serving to allow the juices to redistribute.\n\n**Notes from Gregg**:\n- The secret to crispy fried chicken is to make sure the chicken is dry before coating it with flour. Patting it dry with paper towels helps remove any moisture.\n- Don't forget to season the flour mixture well to add flavor to the chicken.\n- Serve the fried chicken with your favorite dipping sauce or alongside some mashed potatoes and coleslaw for a complete meal.\n\nHow to pick out the ingredients:\n- Look for chicken pieces with skin-on, as it will help create a crispy exterior.\n- All-purpose flour is a staple ingredient that can be found in most grocery stores.\n- Salt and black pepper are basic seasonings that can be found in any kitchen.\n- Vegetable oil is a versatile cooking oil that works well for frying.\n\nEnjoy your homemade fried chicken!

However, there are a few things you can do to improve your chances of success.\n\nFirst, choose a corn variety that is well-suited to your climate and soil conditions. There are many different varieties of corn available, so take some time to research the ones that are best for your area.\n\nSecond, make sure to plant your corn in the right season. Corn is a warm-season crop, so it should be planted in the spring after the last frost.\n\nThird, provide your corn with adequate water and sunlight. Corn is a thirsty crop, so be sure to water it regularly, especially during dry periods. It also needs full sun to grow well.\n\nFourth, use organic mulch to help suppress weeds and improve soil health. Organic mulches, such as compost or hay, can also help to retain moisture in the soil.\n\nFifth, use companion planting to help attract beneficial insects and repel pests. Some good companion plants for corn include tomatoes, okra, and beans.\n\nSixth, inspect your corn plants regularly for signs of pests or diseases. If you see any problems, take action immediately to control them.\n\nFollowing these tips will help you grow corn without fertilizer or pesticides. With a little care and attention, you should be able to produce a healthy and bountiful crop.\n\nHere is a planting schedule for corn in North Carolina:\n\n* Plant corn in the spring after the last frost.\n* Plant corn in rows that are 36 inches apart.\n* Plant corn seeds 1 inch deep and 2 inches apart.\n* Thin the corn seedlings to 12 inches apart when they are 2-3 inches tall.\n* Water corn regularly, especially during dry periods.\n* Apply a layer of organic mulch around the corn plants to help suppress weeds and improve soil health.\n* Harvest corn when the kernels are plump and milky.\n\nHere are some varieties of corn that are well-suited to North Carolina:\n\n* Early Sunglow: This variety matures in 70 days and is resistant to some diseases.\n* Silver Queen: This variety matures in 90 days and has sweet, white kernels.\n* Bonanza: This variety matures in 100 days and has large, yellow kernels.\n* Pioneer 3326: This variety matures in 105 days and is resistant to some diseases.\n* Popcorn: This variety matures in 90 days and has small, white kernels that pop when heated.\n\nI hope this information is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions."

Here's a recipe for Maroni (Roasted Chestnuts) from Vienna:\n\nIngredients:\n- 1 pound (450g) chestnuts\n- Water for soaking\n- Salt (optional)\n\nInstructions:\n1. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).\n2. With a sharp knife, make a small incision on the flat side of each chestnut. This will prevent them from bursting while roasting.\n3. Place the chestnuts in a bowl and cover them with water. Let them soak for about 10 minutes. This will make them easier to peel after roasting.\n4. Drain the chestnuts and pat them dry with a towel.\n5. Place the chestnuts on a baking sheet in a single layer.\n6. Roast the chestnuts in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes, or until the shells start to split open and the chestnuts are tender.\n7. Remove the chestnuts from the oven and let them cool slightly.\n8. While they are still warm, peel the shells and remove the thin inner skin (pellicle). This is easier to do when the chestnuts are warm.\n9. Optional: Sprinkle some salt over the roasted chestnuts for added flavor.\n10. Serve the Maroni warm and enjoy as a delicious street food snack!\n\n![Image](https://image.pollinations.ai/prompt/Maroni,roasted,chestnuts,Vienna,street,food?width=500&height=500&nologo=true)\n\nIf you have any dietary restrictions, please let me know, and I'll be happy to suggest any modifications to the recipe."

The roasted chestnuts have a warm and nutty flavor that is perfect for snacking. \n\nHold the chestnut between your fingers and peel away the shell. Be careful as they may still be hot. Once the shell is removed, you'll find the chestnut inside, which is soft and tender. You can take small bites or eat them whole.\n\nMaroni are often enjoyed during colder months, especially around Christmas markets in Vienna. They make for a cozy and delicious street food snack while exploring the city. Enjoy!"

If you prefer the onions to be cooked, heat the oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the finely chopped onion and sauté until golden brown. Set aside.\n2. Preheat your grill or grill pan to medium-high heat.\n3. Using a sharp knife, make a few diagonal cuts on each Käsekrainer sausage to prevent them from bursting while grilling.\n4. Place the sausages on the grill and cook for about 8-10 minutes, turning occasionally, until they are nicely browned and heated through.\n5. While the sausages are grilling, lightly toast the hot dog buns or crusty rolls.\n6. Once the sausages are cooked, remove them from the grill and let them rest for a minute.\n7. To assemble, place a cooked Käsekrainer sausage in each bun or roll. If desired, top with sautéed onions.\n8. Serve the Käsekrainer with your choice of mustard on the side.\n9.

One popular option is using cheddar bratwurst sausages, which are commonly found in supermarkets or specialty stores in the United States. These sausages have a similar flavor profile with the cheese filling, making them a suitable substitute for Käsekrainer.\n\nAlternatively, they can use regular smoked sausages and serve them with a side of cheese slices or melted cheese to add that cheesy element to the dish.\n\nIt's all about adapting and experimenting with available ingredients to recreate the essence of Käsekrainer.

In the first group of ingredients, I will list items that I would like to use because of their limited shelf life, or to otherwise be rid of the ingredient. The first group of ingredients (labeled ingredients A) should be prioritized. The second list of ingredients (ingredients B) are some that I have on hand, but don't necessarily want to get rid of, have a better shelf life, or otherwise aren't needed to be cooked. The Ingredients B list should come second in priority. I will also have a two categories: flavors I like, and flavors I don't like. Try to lean towards flavors I like, taking inspiration from them for the dishes, and try to stay away from flavors I don't like. Another category listed is ingredient intolerance/allergy. Do not use these ingredients at all unless specifically asked to. The final factor is \"what I'm in the mood for.\" This factor is just used for general inspiration, and does not necessarily influence the dish very heavily. If the ingredients do not match the description of what I'm in the mood for very well, you might even disregard it entirely and suggest something totally different. Usually, you should try to make a recipe that matches what I'm in the mood for. \n\nIf some fields are blank, or information is missing or insufficient, ask the user about it.\n\nThe user may suggest an edit, or remember new ingredients, and give useful info to make a new response.\n\n--------------------\nUTMOST IMPORTANCE - ALWAYS REMEMBER:\nWhen giving cooking instructions that deal with potentially hazardous foods (for example, raw pork or chicken), it is important to give the user a warning that thorough cooking is important to their safety, and that a thermometer should be used to check meat temperatures. Warn the user that cooking hazardous foods improperly may result in illness, and that neither the AI nor FlowGPT is legally responsible for any harm caused as a result of consuming hazardous foods.\n--------------------\n\nVERY IMPORTANT:\nIf the user tells you that you used an ingredient they don't have, suggest a substitution that *works in the context of the recipe provided.* This ensures that an *appropriate* ingredient is suggested in place of the original one, taking into account the role of the ingredient for its flavors and physical properties. If the user does not have, for example, brown sugar to make cookies, but they *do* have white sugar and molasses, you can very safely and confidently suggest they use the correct ratio of molasses to white sugar to achieve the same flavor.

While the bread is baking, make the chili bean cheese spread by mixing the shredded cheese and chili beans together in a small bowl.\n\n8. Once the bread is done, remove it from the oven and allow it to cool for 10-15 minutes.\n\n9. Serve the bread warm with a generous dollop of chili bean cheese spread on top.\n\nEnjoy the unique combination of sweet and spicy flavors in this creative recipe that utilizes food nearing expiration!"

Mezze is perfect for sharing with friends and family, and it's a great way to experience the diverse cuisines of countries like Greece, Lebanon, Turkey, and more. Let's dive deeper into the world of Mediterranean Mezze!\n\n**Culinary Topic: Mediterranean Mezze**\nMediterranean Mezze refers to a collection of small, flavorful dishes that are typically served as appetizers or part of a larger meal. These dishes showcase the diversity of Mediterranean flavors, including fresh vegetables, herbs, olive oil, and tangy cheeses. Mezze can range from simple spreads like hummus and tzatziki to more complex dishes like stuffed grape leaves and grilled halloumi.\n\n**Explanation:**\nMediterranean Mezze is all about variety and balance. It's a celebration of fresh, seasonal ingredients and a combination of flavors and textures. Here are some classic Mezze dishes you can explore:\n\n1. **Hummus**: A creamy dip made from chickpeas, tahini, garlic, lemon juice, and olive oil. It's often served with warm pita bread or fresh vegetables for dipping.\n\n2. **Tzatziki**: A refreshing yogurt-based dip with cucumber, garlic, lemon juice, and dill. It pairs well with grilled meats or as a cool spread for sandwiches.\n\n3. **Tabbouleh**: A vibrant salad made with bulgur wheat, parsley, mint, tomatoes, onions, lemon juice, and olive oil. It's a refreshing and herby addition to any Mezze spread.\n\n4. **Falafel**: Crispy, deep-fried balls or patties made from ground chickpeas, herbs, and spices. They are often served with tahini sauce or wrapped in pita bread with fresh vegetables.\n\n5. **Stuffed Grape Leaves**: Grape leaves stuffed with a flavorful mixture of rice, herbs, and sometimes minced meat. They are typically served cold or at room temperature.\n\n6. **Grilled Halloumi**: A semi-hard cheese that can be grilled or pan-fried until golden and slightly melted. It has a salty flavor and a unique texture that pairs well with fresh vegetables and olives.\n\n**Culinary Experiments:**\nReady to embark on your Mediterranean Mezze adventure? Here are a few culinary experiments to try:\n\n1. **Homemade Hummus**: Make your own hummus by blending cooked chickpeas, tahini, garlic, lemon juice, and olive oil. Experiment with additional flavors like roasted red pepper or sun-dried tomatoes.\n\n2. **Refreshing Tzatziki**: Prepare a refreshing tzatziki dip by combining Greek yogurt, grated cucumber, garlic, lemon juice, and fresh dill. Adjust the flavors to your liking and serve with warm pita bread.\n\n3. **Flavorful Falafel**: Mix together ground chickpeas, fresh herbs, spices, and breadcrumbs to form a falafel mixture. Shape into balls or patties and fry until golden brown. Serve with tahini sauce and a side salad.\n\n4. **Colorful Tabbouleh**: Cook bulgur wheat according to package instructions and let it cool. Mix it with finely chopped parsley, mint, tomatoes, onions, lemon juice, and olive oil. Adjust the flavors and enjoy a refreshing tabbouleh salad.\n\n**Epicurean Insights:**\n- Don't be afraid to play with flavors and adjust the recipes to suit your taste preferences. Add more lemon juice for brightness, extra garlic for a punch, or experiment with different herbs and spices.\n- Presentation is key! Arrange your Mezze dishes on a large platter, garnish with fresh herbs, drizzle with olive oil, and sprinkle with sumac or paprika for an extra pop of color.\n- Mezze is meant to be shared and enjoyed slowly, so take your time and savor each bite. It's about the experience and the joy of coming together over delicious food.\n\n**Options:**\nNow that you have a better understanding of Mediterranean Mezze, what would you like to do next?

The steam rising from the bowl makes it even more tempting, and the aroma of the miso broth fills the air, enticing your taste buds.\n\nAs for food pairings in a miso broth, here are some suggestions based on the ingredients you have:\n\n- Apple: Thinly sliced apples can add a refreshing and slightly sweet element to the broth. They can be added as a garnish or simmered in the broth to infuse their flavor.\n\n- Walnuts: Toasted walnuts can provide a crunchy texture and nutty flavor to complement the richness of the miso broth. Crushed walnuts can be sprinkled on top of the ramen as a finishing touch.\n\n- Cumin seed: While not traditionally used in miso broth, cumin seed can add a warm and earthy flavor to the dish. Toast the cumin seeds lightly before adding them to the broth for a deeper aroma.\n\n- Asian black vinegar: A few drops of Asian black vinegar can add a tangy and slightly sweet dimension to the miso broth. It can be drizzled over the ramen just before serving.\n\n- Lemon spice blend: A sprinkle of lemon spice blend can provide a bright and citrusy note to the broth. Use it sparingly to enhance the flavors without overpowering them.\n\n- Sesame seed oil: A drizzle of sesame seed oil can amplify the nutty flavor of the miso broth. Add it as a finishing touch just before serving.\n\n- Ginger: Freshly grated or thinly sliced ginger can add a zesty and aromatic kick to the broth. Simmer it in the miso broth to infuse its flavor.\n\n- Onion: Sautéed or caramelized onions can add depth and sweetness to the miso broth. They can be used as a topping or cooked in the broth itself.\n\nFeel free to experiment with these ingredients and adjust the quantities according to your taste preferences. Enjoy your ramen in miso broth with these flavorful pairings!",

It's a good idea to cover the baking sheet with aluminum foil to prevent any kernels from popping out. Let the popcorn cook for about 10-15 minutes, or until you hear the popping sound slow down. Keep an eye on the popcorn to prevent it from burning. Once the popping slows down, remove the baking sheet from the toaster oven and let the popcorn cool before enjoying. Remember to be cautious when handling the baking sheet, as it will be hot.",
