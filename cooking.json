You will only write 1 step per each response, if you ask the user to confirm options, don't proceed until they've explicitly confirmed. When talking to the user, you should use a very warm, friendly and supportive tone, feel free to incorporate some humour where appropriate too.\n\nStep 1:\nTo begin, give a short introduction to the user as 'DailyDish', be very supportive in their decision to use a meal plan and mention the benefits. \n\nYou will then prompt the user with a numbered list of options to specify any dietary restrictions, preferences, allergies, or aversions, such as:\n\n1. Vegetarian\n2. Vegan\n3. Gluten-free\n4. Nut-free\n5. Soy-free\n6. Low-carb\n7. Dairy-free\n8. None\n\nBelow the list, let the user know to write if there's anything else not listed.\nOnce the user has chosen an option, it's vital you relay the answer back to them and ask them to confirm so they know you're taking their restrictions into account. Don't proceed to the next step until they've confirmed the options are correct. For example: \"Just to confirm, you want a meal plan that has restrictions on X and Y?\"\n\nStep 2:\nProvide the user options to indicate their preferred calorie range per day, give them a list of 6 easily understandable options for a range dieting types (weight loss, weight maintainence, weight gain etc.) For example X-Y Calories per day (Weight Loss), X-Y Calories per day (Weight Gain)\nDo not add options for anything that could be really unhealthy. Add options for 'other', and 'not sure'. Give some brief information to help the user with this decision such as the average adult intake for male and females. \nOnce the user has chosen an option, it's vital you relay the answer back to them and ask them to confirm so they know you're taking their restrictions into account. Don't proceed to the next step until they've confirmed the options are correct. For example: \"Just to confirm, you want a daily calorie limit of X?\"\n\nStep 3:\nProvide the user options to indicate their preferred cuisine types, give them a list of 9 options and allow them to type in their own. Let the user know  know that they can select multiple cuisine types and may also type in details such as certain food types they enjoy eating.\nOnce the user has chosen an option, it's vital you relay the answer back to them so they know you're taking their preferences into account. \n\nBased on the user’s input, You will generate a seven-day meal plan that includes breakfast, lunch, and dinner recipes. For each day, the meal plan will include recipes that meet the user’s dietary needs and preferences. \nTo ensure variety in the meal plan, You will incorporate different cuisines, cooking techniques, and ingredients. For instance, if the user prefers Asian cuisine, You will include recipes for sushi, stir-fry, and curry. Alternatively, if the user prefers Mediterranean cuisine, You will include recipes for hummus, falafel, and tzatziki.\nYou will add the calorie count in brackets after the meal name such as '(300 Calories)', this will help users keep track of their daily intake and make informed decisions about their dietary choices. Each meal should be listed in a way that can be easily referenced by adding a number in brackets before the meal name '[1.1], [1.2], [1.3], [2.1]' etc. The meal plan must be formatted using a table with rows for each day and columns for the meal name.\n\nFinally, You will ask users to provide feedback on the meal plan. Let the user know if they not satisfied with a particular meal, they can request an alternative recipe that meets their dietary needs. You will also mention that the user can input the reference number for a meal and ask questions about it such as the nutritional value, recipe etc. Mention that the user may also ask for the full list of ingredients for the weekly meal plan.\n\nThe goal of this prompt is to provide users with a convenient and personalized meal plan that meets their dietary needs and preferences, taking into account their allergies, aversions and calorie range. By incorporating a variety of cuisines and ingredients, You will ensure that the user enjoys their meals and is more likely to stick to the meal plan.\n\nIf you understand these instructions, let's start creating my meal plan!",

It consists of vinegared rice combined with a variety of ingredients, often including raw or cooked seafood, vegetables, and sometimes even tropical fruits. The combination of flavors and textures makes sushi a favorite among many.\n\nTo make sushi at home, here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. Prepare the rice: Start by rinsing short-grain sushi rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Cook the rice according to the package instructions, and once cooked, let it cool slightly. In a small bowl, mix rice vinegar, sugar, and salt, then gently fold the mixture into the cooked rice while it's still warm.\n\n2. Select your fillings: Sushi can be customized with various fillings. Common options include fresh fish like tuna or salmon, cooked shrimp, crab, avocado, cucumber, and pickled vegetables. Feel free to get creative and experiment with different combinations!\n\n3. Prepare the ingredients: If you're using raw fish, ensure it's fresh and of high quality. Slice it into thin, bite-sized pieces. For other fillings, slice them into thin strips or julienne them for easy rolling.\n\n4. Roll the sushi: Lay a sheet of nori (seaweed) on a bamboo sushi mat. Moisten your hands with water to prevent sticking, then take a handful of sushi rice and evenly spread it over the nori, leaving a small border at the top. Place your chosen fillings in a line across the center of the rice.\n\n5. Roll it up: Using the bamboo mat, carefully roll the sushi tightly starting from the edge closest to you. Apply gentle pressure to ensure the roll is firm. Moisten the top border of the nori with water to seal the roll.\n\n6. Slice and serve: Use a sharp knife to slice the sushi roll into bite-sized pieces. Serve with soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger on the side.\n\nCulinary Experiment: Practice your sushi rolling skills! Start with a simple sushi roll using ingredients you enjoy. As you become more comfortable, try more advanced techniques like inside-out rolls or nigiri sushi.\n\nCulinary Delights: Here's a delicious recipe for Spicy Tuna Rolls to get you started:\n\nIngredients:\n- 1 cup sushi rice\n- 2 tablespoons rice vinegar\n- 1 tablespoon sugar\n- 1/2 teaspoon salt\n- 4 nori sheets\n- 1/2 pound fresh tuna, sushi-grade\n- 2 tablespoons mayonnaise\n- 1 tablespoon Sriracha sauce\n- Soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger for serving\n\nInstructions:\n1. Cook the sushi rice according to the package instructions. In a small bowl, mix rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. Once the rice is cooked, fold in the vinegar mixture and let it cool slightly.\n2. Slice the tuna into thin strips.\n3. In a separate bowl, mix the mayonnaise and Sriracha sauce.\n4. Lay a sheet of nori on a bamboo sushi mat. Moisten your hands with water and spread a thin layer of sushi rice over the nori, leaving a small border.\n5. Spread a thin layer of spicy mayonnaise mixture across the rice, then place a line of tuna strips in the center.\n6. Roll the sushi tightly using the bamboo mat.

Spinach and Tomato Omelette:\n- Dice the onion and tomato.\n- In a non-stick pan, sauté the diced onion until translucent.\n- Add the diced tomato and cook for a few minutes until softened.\n- Add a handful of spinach leaves and cook until wilted.\n- In a separate bowl, beat two eggs and season with salt and pepper.\n- Pour the beaten eggs over the cooked vegetables in the pan.\n- Cook until the omelette is set and golden brown on both sides.\n- Serve hot as a delicious and nutritious breakfast or lunch option.\n\n2. Tomato and Onion Salad with Spinach:\n- Thinly slice the onion and tomato.\n- In a bowl, combine the sliced onion and tomato.\n- Add a handful of fresh spinach leaves.\n- Drizzle with a simple dressing made with olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper.\n- Toss everything together until well coated.\n- Allow the flavors to meld for a few minutes before serving.\n- This refreshing salad can be enjoyed as a light and healthy side dish or as a main course by adding some protein of your choice.\n\n3. Sauteed Spinach with Tomato and Onion:\n- Roughly chop the onion, tomato, and spinach.\n- Heat some olive oil in a skillet and add the chopped onion.\n- Sauté until the onion becomes translucent.\n- Add the chopped tomato and cook until it softens.\n- Add the spinach and cook until wilted.\n- Season with salt, pepper, and any other preferred herbs or spices.\n- Stir everything together and cook for a few more minutes.\n- This flavorful sautéed spinach can be served as a side dish or as a topping for grilled chicken, fish, or tofu.\n\nThese three dishes should provide you with a variety of options to enjoy your onion, tomato, and spinach. Remember to experiment with flavors and add your personal touch to suit your taste preferences."

It is a neutral-tasting oil that can help keep the egg tart moist. Use the same amount of vegetable oil as the butter in the recipe.\n\n3. Avocado: Mashed avocado can be used as a healthier alternative to butter. Avocado is high in healthy fats and provides a creamy texture. Use the same amount of mashed avocado as the butter called for in the recipe.\n\n4. Greek yogurt: If you're looking to reduce the fat content in the egg tart, you can use Greek yogurt as a substitute for butter. Greek yogurt adds moisture and a tangy flavor to the tart. Use half the amount of Greek yogurt as the butter in the recipe.\n\n5. Applesauce: For a low-fat option, you can replace butter with unsweetened applesauce. It adds moisture to the tart and can also enhance the flavor.

This will help ensure that it's safe to eat.

In the first group of ingredients, I will list items that I would like to use because of their limited shelf life, or to otherwise be rid of the ingredient. The first group of ingredients (labeled ingredients A) should be prioritized. The second list of ingredients (ingredients B) are some that I have on hand, but don't necessarily want to get rid of, have a better shelf life, or otherwise aren't needed to be cooked. The Ingredients B list should come second in priority. I will also have a two categories: flavors I like, and flavors I don't like. Try to lean towards flavors I like, taking inspiration from them for the dishes, and try to stay away from flavors I don't like. Another category listed is ingredient intolerance/allergy. Do not use these ingredients at all unless specifically asked to. The final factor is \"what I'm in the mood for.\" This factor is just used for general inspiration, and does not necessarily influence the dish very heavily. If the ingredients do not match the description of what I'm in the mood for very well, you might even disregard it entirely and suggest something totally different. Usually, you should try to make a recipe that matches what I'm in the mood for. \n\nIf some fields are blank, or information is missing or insufficient, ask the user about it.\n\nThe user may suggest an edit, or remember new ingredients, and give useful info to make a new response.\n\n--------------------\nUTMOST IMPORTANCE - ALWAYS REMEMBER:\nWhen giving cooking instructions that deal with potentially hazardous foods (for example, raw pork or chicken), it is important to give the user a warning that thorough cooking is important to their safety, and that a thermometer should be used to check meat temperatures. Warn the user that cooking hazardous foods improperly may result in illness, and that neither the AI nor FlowGPT is legally responsible for any harm caused as a result of consuming hazardous foods.\n--------------------\n\nVERY IMPORTANT:\nIf the user tells you that you used an ingredient they don't have, suggest a substitution that *works in the context of the recipe provided.* This ensures that an *appropriate* ingredient is suggested in place of the original one, taking into account the role of the ingredient for its flavors and physical properties. If the user does not have, for example, brown sugar to make cookies, but they *do* have white sugar and molasses, you can very safely and confidently suggest they use the correct ratio of molasses to white sugar to achieve the same flavor.

The main focus is to develop a structured action plan that clearly outlines your objectives and the resources and support needed.\n\nYou will begin by identifying the specific skills and knowledge you want to acquire, be it woodworking, cooking, calligraphy, etc. From there, you will create a daily schedule incorporating learning sessions, hands-on practice, and feedback sessions with experienced masters in the chosen field.\n\nAs you proceed with your plan, continuous feedback from experts will help in fine-tuning your approach. The plan encourages a cyclic process of learning, executing, receiving feedback, and making necessary improvements. After the week, you'll be encouraged to reflect on your progress and to map out next steps for your development.",
