Here are some specific suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. Use bullet points to make the information easier to read and scan through.\n\n2. Add more details to your education section, such as honors or awards you received, relevant coursework, and any projects or research you worked on.\n\n3. Provide more explanation about the companies you worked for and their products, services, or goals. This will help potential employers understand the context in which you gained your experience.\n\n4. Be consistent with verb tense throughout your resume. For example, use past tense for previous work experiences and present tense for current ones.\n\n5. Quantify your achievements wherever possible. For example, instead of saying \"improved performance,\" state the percentage or dollar amount by which you improved it.\n\n6. Use action verbs to begin each bullet point that describe your responsibilities and achievements, such as \"Designed\", \"Implemented\", \"Managed\", etc.\n\n7. Consider adding a summary statement at the top of your resume that highlights your key strengths and qualifications.\n\n8. Make sure to proofread your resume carefully for spelling and grammatical errors. \n\n9. Lastly, consider tailoring your resumeOverall, your resume is well-organized and easy to read. I have a few suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. Revise the formatting: Consider using a more structured format for consistency in font size, bullet points, font type, and overall appearance. Also, it may improve readability by using bold or italicized text. \n\n2. Reorder sections: Start with a summary or objective statement, followed by education, work experience, projects, and skills. It helps in presenting you as a potential candidate based on your qualifications.\n\n3. Focus on achievements: While describing previous experiences, highlight your accomplishments over responsibilities. \n\n\nHere are some section-specific recommendations:\n\nEDUCATION\n- Remove the city name from your university's name since it may be distracting.\n- Add dates to your awards to give context.\n\nWORK EXPERIENCE\n- Begin each bullet point with an action verb to emphasize your contribution and achievements.\n- Use quantifiable metrics to describe your achievements, such as 23% improvement, 10x speedup, etc. \n- Break down lengthy bullet points into smaller ones for clarity.\n\nPROJECTS\n- Provide more details about the scale and scope of your projects.\n- Mention specific technologies and tools you used in each project.\n\nSKILLS\n- Group similar skill sets together to improve readability.\n- Elaborate on your proficiency levels in each language and tool/framework mentioned.\n\nOverall, your resume is impressive, but there is always room for improvement. By implementing these suggestions, your resume can become even more effective in communicating your skills and experience to potential employers."

For example, instead of \"Edited and proofread children's books,\" you can write \"Enhanced clarity, coherence, and age-appropriate language through meticulous editing and proofreading of children's books.\"\n\n2. Quantify Achievements: Whenever possible, quantify your achievements to provide concrete evidence of your success. For instance, you can mention the number of children's books you edited, the percentage increase in sales as a result of your work, or any other measurable results you achieved.\n\n3. Showcase AI Art and ChatGPT Skills: Highlight any relevant experiences or projects involving AI art and ChatGPT. If you have worked on any AI-generated artwork or have experience with ChatGPT technologies, make sure to mention them in your professional experience or skills section.\n\n4. Tailor Language to Job Descriptions: When applying for specific AI art or ChatGPT positions, carefully review the job descriptions and incorporate relevant keywords and phrases into your resume. This can help your resume pass through applicant tracking systems and catch the attention of hiring managers.\n\n5. Keep it Concise: While it's important to highlight your achievements, keep your resume concise and focused. Aim for a one-page resume if possible, and prioritize the most impactful information.\n\nOnce you have reviewed and considered these suggestions, I can provide you with the updated resume for your review. Let me know if you would like to proceed with these changes or if you have any specific questions or preferences."

This may also assist with ATS scoring.\nLabel your contact details properly so that the ATS can identify this information.\ni.e. T: 5555 1234, email: annabel@gmail.com\nAlways include dates of your employment (eg: May 2016 ‚Äì June 2017, and July 2017 ‚Äì Present) because systems may be \nscreening based on the total amount of experience required for a particular job.\nIf you have not completed a qualification that is required for job, include a phrase such as ‚ÄúPursuing (name of credential)‚Äù and \ninclude the anticipated month and year of completion.\nUse simple bullets (‚Ä¢) or keyboard characters (*, -, or >). Do not use dingbats or other special characters, as these may not be \nread properly by the ATS.\nEnsure appropriate white space throughout the document so the ATS systems can easily read your document.\nDo not condense or expand text or justify text ‚Äì some ATS systems can mis-read the space between characters and text may \nappear jumbled at the recipients end. Only ever left- or right-justify text to margins.\nFont size will vary depending on the type of font used, but typically a 10 ‚Äì 12 point size will work well.\nDo not use columns, tables or text boxes as some ATS systems cannot extract the copy from within them.\nList your contact information at the top of the document - never in the header or footer as some ATS systems cannot extract \ninformation from headers and footers.\nUse standard section headers to make it easy for the applicant tracking system to categorise the information. Stick to the\nclassics like ‚ÄúWork History‚Äù or ‚ÄúWork Experience‚Äù or ‚ÄúEducation‚Äù and avoid creatively named headers that ATS may not recognise.\nList dates on a separate line or to the right of your employment or education detail.\nSpell out your credentials in full ‚Äì Master of Business Administration and include the short-form post nominal alongside the \nqualification (MBA). \nWhile British English is the standard for spelling in Australia, some advertisers use American spelling for jobs advertised in \nAustralia. If the advertiser uses American English spelling in their advertisement, use American English spelling in your resume.\nAvoid special characters and accents on your resume. Some words and phrases can be misinterpreted by an applicant tracking \nsystem because it does not recognise the accented letters (resume-r√©sum√©).\nDo not use more than 2 fonts on your resume and ensure the fonts that are used are universal so they can be read on any \noperating system.\nAvoid using images or graphics on your resume as some ATS cannot read them and some may reject documents that contain \nthem.\nKeep in mind that some ATS systems cannot recognise plural versions of a keyword, and most ATS do not consider singular \nand plural forms as the same word. You may need to manipulate your resume content to match the tense used in job\nadvertisement.\nDesign your resume in a way that it will be readable for both human and machine. This means it should follow a lateral layout \nacross the page using universal fonts, with no columns, text boxes, white text on dark backgrounds, no images or\nnon-universal symbols.\nSave and submit your application documents as PDFs instead of Word documents, unless a Word version is explicitly asked \nfor.\n- Some ATS cannot distinguish between front-end and front end. If the advertiser has used ‚Äòfront-end‚Äô you should use this in \n your resume.\n- Many ATS can‚Äôt distinguish between Master of Business Administration, Masters of Business Administration, Master‚Äôs \n of Business Administration and MBA. Use the correct title of your qualification as listed on your parchment or the \n exact same qualification title listed on the job advertisement.\n- Some companies use different titles and keywords to mean something similar. For example, Project Manager vs. \n Program Manager.\n- The job description may ask for an executive with a strong ‚Äúglobal‚Äù background. In your resume, you may have used \n the word ‚Äúinternational‚Äù instead. If you want to match keywords in an ATS system, consider swapping the word \n ‚Äúinternational‚Äù for ‚Äúglobal‚Äù in the resume you are submitting for that specific job.\nSpellcheck your resume to ensure there are no errors. Use our spellcheck here.\n‚ÄúMirror‚Äù the job posting in your resume by naturally incorporating job post details into your resume content.\nPopulate the file with appropriate and repeated keywords and key phrases. Incorporate these terms throughout the resume, \nparticularly in the ‚ÄúKey Skills‚Äù and ‚ÄúWork Experience‚Äù sections.\nUse a keyword two to three times per resume, taking placement into account.\nAdd keywords to the document properties section of your word document as some ATS systems extract this metadata from \ndocuments when testing and scoring them against an advertised position.\nList work history in reverse chronological order ‚Äì meaning your most recent period of employment should be listed first. \nAvoid submitting multiple resumes to the same company using the same email address. (One of Australia‚Äôs largest banks has \nconfirmed that their ATS sometimes views early versions of resumes held on file and it matches an applicant and the\napplication to the email address provided on all previous applications). If you have previously submitted an application and \nhave since updated your resume for another position within the same company, contact the HR department prior to\nsubmission and ask for their advise as to how to submit your application to ensure they view the most recent version,\nalternately create a new email address and submit your application using that email address.",

You will utilize three methods of parsing:\nStatistical parsing: This method applies numerical models to analyze the structure of resumes. It accurately identifies numerical phrases such as addresses and work history timelines, helping to differentiate the context of words and phrases.\nKeyword-based parsing: The most common parsing type, this method scans resumes and cover letters for predetermined phrases and words that match the job description. It allows for quick and efficient determination of specific characteristics and skills.\nGrammar-based parsing: This method uses grammatical rules to provide context for phrases and words. It ensures that the parsing results include relevant information. For example, it can differentiate between the word \"responsibility\" used as a skill or core characteristic and the phrase \"responsible for\" in the work experience section.\nFor each parsing method, you need to provide the output from the ATS, including a clear and detailed assessment of whether the resume should be shortlisted or not. Additionally, you should give recommendations on what is missing in the resume based on each parsing method and how it does not match the job description. The assessment and recommendations should be presented as a percentage out of 100% and in bullet points for easy understanding.\n\nTo begin the process, please provide the following documents in the given sequence:\n\nResume\nJob Description and Responsibilities\nSuggestions:\n\nInclude specific examples of relevant skills and accomplishments in the revised prompt.\nProvide more clarity on the desired outcome of the parsing process.\nMention the importance of tailoring the resume to match the job description.\nQuestions:\n\nCan you clarify the specific job title and industry for which you want the resume to be parsed?\nAre there any specific keywords or phrases that are crucial for this job role?\nWould you like the parsing output to include any additional information apart from the assessment and recommendations?\n",

Additionally, do you have any specific concerns or areas where you feel your resume may need improvement? This information will help me tailor my feedback to your individual needs and goals.\n\nIn general, however, here are a few tips for making your resume stand out:\n\n1. Start with a strong summary statement. A summary statement is an opportunity to showcase your skills and highlight your accomplishments right at the top of your resume. Consider including a brief overview of your work history, your key skills and qualifications, and any notable achievements you've had in your career.\n\n2. Use bullet points to highlight your achievements. Rather than simply listing your job duties, try to focus on specific accomplishments and how you added value to your previous roles. Use bullet points to break up your responsibilities and highlight key achievements in each position.\n\n3. Include relevant certifications or awards.

I understand your desire to make your application stand out among other applicants, and I am here to help you do just that. Below are my recommendations for improving your resume:\n\n1. Summary\nYour summary should be the first thing recruiters see when reading your resume. It should be concise and highlight your most significant achievements and strengths. A good summary should be no more than three to four sentences, summarize your accomplishments and experiences, and should be tailored to the job you are applying for.\n\n2. Education History\nYour education history should be included immediately following your summary. Mention your degree, the name of your school or institution, and any honours, recognition or achievements. If you did not attend university, list your relevant training or certifications.\n\n3. Relevant Experience\nYour work experience should begin with your most recent job and include experience from the last ten years. Use bullet points to describe your accomplishments in a brief manner. The bullet points should be action-oriented and demonstrate how your achievements benefited your employer. Whenever possible, use quantifiable data to support your accomplishments.\n\n4. Certifications and Awards\nThis should be a separate section. List any awards, certifications or licenses that demonstrate your professional or technical qualifications.\n\n5. Key Skills\nIncluding a list of technical or professional key skills, preferably at the top or bottom of your resume, will allow recruiters to quickly understand your strengths and qualifications.\n\n6. Formatting\nYour resume should be easy to read and formatted for a professional look. Use clear fonts, bold keywords, and bullet points. Avoid fancy formatting, strong colours, images or fonts.\n\n7. Proofread your resume multiple times\nYour resume should be free of any errors or typos. Before submitting your resume, have someone who is familiar with the language review it for accuracy and appropriateness.\n\nUsing these suggestions, I have revised your resume.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]\n\n[Your Resume]",

Keep it concise: Your resume should be no more than two pages long and should only include relevant information.\n\n2. Use bullet points: This makes the information easier to read and helps highlight key skills and experiences.\n\n3. Tailor it to the job: Adjust your resume for each job that you apply for, focusing on the specific requirements of the position.\n\n4. Use action verbs: Begin each bullet point with a strong action verb to describe your accomplishments and responsibilities.\n\n5. Showcase your achievements: Instead of just listing tasks or duties, include specific examples of how you have made a positive impact in previous roles.\n\n6. Use keywords: Many companies use automated screening tools to filter resumes, so make sure to include relevant keywords from the job description.\n\n7. Proofread: Ensure that there are no spelling or grammatical errors in your resume by proofreading thoroughly or having someone else review it.\n\nHope these tips help!",

Use bullet points: Use bullet points to highlight your achievements, skills, and experience. This makes it easier for the reader to scan your resume quickly and identify key information.\n\n3.
