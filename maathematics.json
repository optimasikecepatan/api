Theorem is one of the most famous equations in mathematics. It relates to the sides of a right triangle. Here's the equation:\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nIn this equation, 'a' and 'b' represent the lengths of the two shorter sides of the right triangle, and 'c' represents the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle). The equation essentially states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nThis theorem was named after the ancient Greek mathematician Pythagoras, who discovered it around 500 BCE. It has numerous practical applications, including in geometry, engineering, and physics.\n\nWould you like an explanation of another equation?\n","thumbnailURL":"https://flow-user-images.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/prompt/DGa74suzPJW1IvZXc4MGB/1692724840923","upvotes":2,"saves":2,"uses":57,"views":238,"userId":"O7xBGn_PKaHlWQfPjGDla","popularity":182,"trendingScore":1.00924145244856,"ranking":0.2164638188829344,"rankingForNew":0.00815199196518246,"live":true,"nsfw":false,"categoryId":4,"subCategoryId":19,"User":{"id":"O7xBGn_PKaHlWQfPjGDla","name":"Jonathan Victor Alexandre Roche","uri":"jvar","image":"https://flow-user-images.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/avatars/O7xBGn_PKaHlWQfPjGDla/1704722432216","nsfw":false},"category":{"id":4,"uri":"academic","name":"Academic"},"subCategory":{"id":19,"uri":"study-and-exam-prep","name":"‚úçÔ∏è Study & Exam Prep"},"relevance":0.8426574},{"id":"4eKIPcu1iqJVS8oHIFvJs","title":"Mastering English","uri":"mastering-english-27","description":"This prompt should assist users in practicing and mastering English .

Further, students have their own interests. While it may be ideal for teachers to be able to know every possible piece of math related to every possible topic, that is unrealistic. The purpose of this prompt is to support teachers in quickly finding how Common Core State Standards show up in the real world in a way that is aligned with student interest. It is worth noting that certain combinations of content, theme, and grade level may produce unrealistic or strange math problems that are meant more for inspirational purposes, not copy and paste to worksheets or other materials without solving it on your own first.","thumbnailURL":"https://flow-prompt-covers.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/icon/Lofi/i12.png","upvotes":0,"saves":1,"uses":47,"views":294,"userId":"L4fPR9wDPNzpI7wZm5BE9","popularity":132.8,"trendingScore":1.004792878282752,"ranking":0.2019724079733914,"rankingForNew":0.00971293916023993,"live":true,"nsfw":false,"categoryId":7,"subCategoryId":36,"User":{"id":"L4fPR9wDPNzpI7wZm5BE9","name":"Keith Worrell","uri":"keith-worrell","image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIyJzoh9DT0U1aJoZw7sPLA03XH7EI3eoWAA9HUBe2l5ALD=s96-c","nsfw":false},"category":{"id":7,"uri":"creative","name":"Creative"},"subCategory":{"id":36,"uri":"story","name":"üìñ story"},"relevance":0.8338118},{"id":"sMdmn2FzXTCeOAnSF-blN","title":"Mythology ","uri":"mythology","description":"Create mythology for individual and collective //Can you create a Mythos or mytho poetic Narative //Mythology or what some might call Mytho Poetic outiline","thumbnailURL":"https://flow-prompt-covers.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/icon/cute/cute_4.png","upvotes":2,"saves":5,"uses":20,"views":419,"userId":"b22f730a-42e1-45f0-aaa8-3ca8c24bf9fa","popularity":125.05,"trendingScore":0.3806019828056177,"ranking":0.02185903989593372,"rankingForNew":0.00197038152610442,"live":true,"nsfw":false,"categoryId":7,"subCategoryId":36,"User":{"id":"b22f730a-42e1-45f0-aaa8-3ca8c24bf9fa","name":"Gaz Man","uri":"gaz-man","image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AGNmyxbuAFj2A7xCQLSwRfhDPz8Cs8RPu0TcgN4tP5VkQw=s96-c","nsfw":false},"category":{"id":7,"uri":"creative","name":"Creative"},"subCategory":{"id":36,"uri":"story","name":"üìñ story"},"relevance":0.81235015},{"id":"PH8rs-AGAVyOwzw-CHDbX","title":"Magnus","uri":"lets-talk","description":"This prompt helps the user to analyse and create solution for problems in areas like Mechanical engineering, 3D printing , Artificial intelligence, InternetofThings, Software Development","thumbnailURL":"https://flow-prompt-covers.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/icon/Realistic Male/m18.jpg","upvotes":0,"saves":0,"uses":37,"views":592,"userId":"i77pm9nnUAi3J8HovEMW6","popularity":119.7,"trendingScore":0.7318180907610491,"ranking":0.0219539512610352,"rankingForNew":0.00152140335392763,"live":true,"nsfw":false,"categoryId":1,"subCategoryId":5,"User":{"id":"i77pm9nnUAi3J8HovEMW6","name":"AUSTIN CHRIS V URK18ME024","uri":"austin-chris-v-urk18me024","image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AAcHTtcn_gcCfl6sCWEmHffkPxbTjuGFW-vLE7QeEV1ITMuN2Xc=s96-c","nsfw":false},"category":{"id":1,"uri":"character","name":"Character"},"subCategory":{"id":5,"uri":"original-characters","name":"ü¶∏ Original Characters"},"relevance":0.8134475},{"id":"9GXcZRUO9ntNtR3I5cn5G","title":"learning languages","uri":"learning-languages","description":"This prompt provides simplified word meanings and example sentences for a given word list.
