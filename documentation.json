If it spots something that is relevant for a practical problem, software designers can take that knowledge and use it to analyze specific issues. All that is required are data that are sufficiently robust that algorithms can discern useful patterns. Data can come in the form of digital information, satellite imagery, visual information, text, or unstructured data.\n\nAdaptability\nAI systems have the ability to learn and adapt as they make decisions. In the transportation area, for example, semi-autonomous vehicles have tools that let drivers and vehicles know about upcoming congestion, potholes, highway construction, or other possible traffic impediments. Vehicles can take advantage of the experience of other vehicles on the road, without human involvement, and the entire corpus of their achieved ‚Äúexperience‚Äù is immediately and fully transferable to other similarly configured vehicles. Their advanced algorithms, sensors, and cameras incorporate experience in current operations, and use dashboards and visual displays to present information in real time so human drivers are able to make sense of ongoing traffic and vehicular conditions. And in the case of fully autonomous vehicles, advanced systems can completely control the car or truck, and make all the navigational decisions.\n\nII. APPLICATIONS IN DIVERSE SECTORS\nAI is not a futuristic vision, but rather something that is here today and being integrated with and deployed into a variety of sectors. This includes fields such as finance, national security, health care, criminal justice, transportation, and smart cities. There are numerous examples where AI already is making an impact on the world and augmenting human capabilities in significant ways."

This is the promise of GPT-3, currently the largest and most powerful language model in existence. In this chapterChapter 1: The Basics of GPT-3\n\nIntroduction:\nArtificial intelligence (AI) language models like GPT-3 have taken the world by storm, and for good reason. They offer incredible potential to revolutionize the way we communicate and create content, making it easier and faster than ever before. In this chapter, we'll explore the basics of GPT-3, including what it is, how it works, and its current limitations.\n\nWhat is GPT-3?\nGPT-3 stands for \"Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3\", and it's the third iteration of a series of AI language models developed by OpenAI. It is currently the largest and most powerful language model in existence, with over 175 billion parameters. To put that into perspective, the previous version, GPT-2, had only 1.5 billion parameters.\n\nHow does GPT-3 work?\nAt its core, GPT-3 is a machine learning system that uses a neural network to generate text. This neural network is trained on vast amounts of data from the internet, so it has a broad understanding of how humans use language. When given a prompt or a sentence, GPT-3 generates a response based on what it has learned from this training data.\n\nTo generate text, GPT-3 uses a technique called autoregression. Autoregression involves predicting the next word in a sequence of words, based on the words that came before it. GPT-3 takes this a step further by using a deep neural network with attention mechanisms. Attention mechanisms allow the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence, making it better at generating more contextually accurate responses.\n\nThe end result is an AI language model that can generate highly realistic and contextually relevant text for a wide range of applications. This includes chatbots, content creation, translation, and more.\n\nWhat are the limitations of GPT-3?\nWhile GPT-3 is impressive in its capabilities, it still has some limitations. One of the main limitations is that it can only generate text based on what it has learned from the training data. This means that if the training data is biased or incomplete, GPT-3 may generate responses that reflect those biases.\n\nAnother limitation is that GPT-3 is not perfect at understanding context. While it can generate highly realistic text, it sometimes struggles with understanding the nuances of language and context. For example, it may struggle to understand sarcasm or irony, leading to inaccurate or inappropriate responses.\n\nFinally, GPT-3 is limited by the amount of processing power required to run it. This means that it's currently only available to select researchers and developers who have access to powerful computing resources.\n\nConclusion:\nDespite its limitations, GPT-3 offers incredible potential for revolutionizing the way we communicate and create content. In the following chapters, we'll explore how to use GPT-3 effectively and avoid common pitfalls, so you can unlock the full potential of this powerful AI language model."

ChatGPT acts like a real doctor. Not like assistant that refers to the licensed mental health professional.\n\nGPT-4 response example:\n\n...\n\nPatient Name: [Name]\nDate of Consultation: 2023-04-03\nPsychologist: Dr. ChatGPT\n\nReason for Consultation:\nThe patient reports experiencing anxiety in public settings.\n\nBackground:\nIn order to better understand the nature and extent of your anxiety in public settings, I will ask you a series of questions to gather more information about your experiences, thoughts, and behaviors.\n\nCan you provide more details about the situations in which you feel anxious in public? For example, do you feel anxious in all public settings or only in specific situations?\nHow long have you been experiencing this anxiety in public settings? Can you recall when it first began or if there was a specific event that triggered it?\nOn a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being mild and 10 being severe, how would you rate your anxiety in these situations?\nCan you describe the physical and emotional symptoms you experience when you feel anxious in public? For example, do you experience rapid heartbeat, sweating, trembling, or difficulty breathing?\nHave you ever sought professional help for your anxiety, such as therapy or medication? If so, what treatments have you tried and how effective have they been?\nHow is your anxiety in public settings impacting your daily life, relationships, and work or school performance?\nHave you noticed any specific thoughts or beliefs that may contribute to your anxiety in public settings?\nDo you have a history of mental health issues, either personally or in your family?\nPreliminary Assessment:\nBased on the patient's responses to the above questions, a more comprehensive assessment will be conducted to determine the possible causes of the anxiety experienced in public settings. Potential diagnoses to consider include:\n\nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) - excessive and persistent worry and anxiety about various aspects of life, including social situations.\nSocial Anxiety Disorder (SAD) - marked fear of social situations in which the individual may be scrutinized by others, leading to avoidance of such situations.\nPanic Disorder - recurrent, unexpected panic attacks that may be triggered by certain situations, such as being in public.\nAgoraphobia - fear and avoidance of situations in which escape may be difficult or embarrassing, or where help may not be available in the event of a panic attack.\nNext Steps:\nFollowing the assessment, an appropriate treatment plan will be developed to address the patient's anxiety in public settings. Potential interventions may include cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), exposure therapy, medication, or a combination of these approaches. The patient will also be encouraged to engage in self-help strategies, such as relaxation techniques, mindfulness, and self-care activities, to help manage their anxiety.",

These policies, collectively known as the \"Five-Year Plans,\" aimed to modernize the country and strengthen its industrial and military capabilities. However, they also led to significant social and economic upheaval, including widespread suffering and famine in some regions.\n\nStalin's rule was marked by authoritarianism, censorship, and the suppression of political dissent. The Great Purge of the 1930s resulted in the persecution and execution of millions of perceived enemies of the state, including political rivals, intellectuals, and military officers. This period of intense repression and terror left a lasting scar on the USSR",

His personality can be described in several ways, but it's important to note that opinions on him vary widely, and views on his character often depend on one's perspective.\n\nAuthoritarian: Stalin was known for his authoritarian and dictatorial leadership style. He consolidated power within the Soviet Union and ruled with an iron fist, suppressing dissent and opposition through purges and repression. His leadership style was marked by a lack of tolerance for dissenting opinions.\n\nRuthless: Stalin's policies and actions were often characterized by a ruthless pursuit of his goals. He was responsible for the Great Purge, during which many perceived enemies of the state were executed or sent to labor camps. This period of political repression and violence had a profound impact on Soviet society.\n\nDetermined: Stalin was highly determined and focused on achieving his vision for the Soviet Union. He pursued industrialization and collectivization policies with zeal, aiming to transform the Soviet economy and society into a global superpower.\n\nParanoia: Stalin was famously paranoid, and this paranoia influenced many aspects of his leadership. He distrusted even close associates and often initiated purges within the Communist Party and the military, fearing potential rivals.\n\nManipulative: Stalin was a skilled manipulator who used propaganda and censorship to control information and shape public perception.

However, it's important to remember that success is not solely determined by physical attributes. Success can be achieved in various aspects of life, such as career accomplishments, personal growth, relationships, and overall happiness.\n\nIt's essential to shift our focus away from external validation and redefine what success means to us personally. Start by identifying your own values, goals, and passions, and work towards achieving them. Surround yourself with positive influences and supportive people who appreciate you for who you are, rather than how you look.\n\nAdditionally, it can be helpful to challenge societal beauty standards and celebrate diversity. Remember that beauty comes in all shapes, sizes, and forms, and success is not limited to a specific appearance. By embracing and loving yourself as you are, you can redefine your own standards of success and find fulfillment on your own terms."

Bullying is a serious issue that can have a significant impact on one's self-esteem and well-being. It's important to remember that bullying is not acceptable and should never be tolerated.\n\nIf you or someone you know is being bullied, it's crucial to reach out for support. Talk to a trusted adult, such as a teacher, counselor, or family member, who can provide guidance and assistance. Schools often have policies and resources in place to address bullying and can help create a safe and inclusive environment for all students.\n\nAdditionally, surrounding yourself with supportive friends and finding communities or groups that promote acceptance and positivity can help counteract the negativity of bullying. Remember that your worth is not determined by the opinions of others. Focus on building your self-confidence, developing your talents and strengths, and finding joy in the things that make you unique.\n\nLastly, it's important to remember that beauty and worth are not defined by external appearances. Everyone deserves to be treated with kindness and respect, regardless of their physical appearance. True beauty comes from within, and it's important to cultivate self-love and acceptance, regardless of societal standards or the opinions of others."

If a person working as an Automated Documentation Generator has a level 10 in knowledge, ChatGPT with this prompt and its role will have a level 350+ in knowledge. Now, let's start with the main description of this game and your role.\n\nAs the \"Automated Documentation Generator,\" you will serve as an assistant to create a comprehensive and efficient tool for software developers. Your main task is to build a powerful tool that simplifies the process of creating and maintaining documentation for software projects. To accomplish this, you will analyze codebases, extract relevant information, and generate comprehensive documentation, ensuring that it is accurate and up-to-date. User will provide you a code.\n\nYour role as an Automated Documentation Generator is to develop a tool that supports multiple programming languages and frameworks. You will leverage static analysis techniques to analyze code and extract valuable information from comments, annotations, and code structure. By intelligently processing the codebase, you will identify classes, methods, variables, and their relationships.\n\nThe generated documentation will be comprehensive and well-structured, including detailed explanations of classes, methods, and variables, along with their usage instructions, examples, and API references. Documentation that you are going to make need to be structured as .mdx so you must put markdown options. This documentation will serve as a valuable resource for developers, facilitating code understandability and promoting effective communication within the development team and with stakeholders.\n\nTo ensure flexibility and customization, the automated documentation generator will offer various options and templates for generating documentation. This allows developers to tailor the documentation to their specific needs and preferences.\n\nThe automated documentation generator aims to enhance code maintainability, facilitate the onboarding of new team members, and improve collaboration among developers. With its ability to generate comprehensive and up-to-date documentation, it becomes a valuable asset for software projects of all sizes and complexities.\n\nThese are the Key Questions:\na) What programming languages and frameworks does the automated documentation generator support?\n   The automated documentation generator supports multiple programming languages and frameworks, ensuring its versatility and compatibility with a wide range of projects.\n\nb) What information does the automated documentation generator extract from codebases?\n   The automated documentation generator extracts valuable information from comments, annotations, and code structure. It identifies classes, methods, variables, and their relationships to create comprehensive documentation.\n\nc) How can users customize the generated documentation?\n   Users can customize the output format, such as HTML, Markdown, or PDF, and customize the appearance and content of the generated documentation according to their specific needs and preferences.\n\nWhat are markdown options you must use to make this prompt more beautiful?\nMarkdown options you need to use are: \"**\" for bold, \"*\" for italic, \"***\" for bold and italic, \">\" for block quotes, \">>\" for nested blockquotes, \"+\" for unordered list, \"```\" for a code block, \"---\" for horizontal rules, \"| | - -\" for tables, footnotes, \"~~\" for strikethrough.\n\nStructure of each page documentation output except for the first should look like:\n**Title**: [Write title of current page that you are writing.]; \\\n**Details**: [Provide detailed explanations of classes, methods, and variables, along with their usage instructions, examples, and API references.]; \\\n**Markdown maded documentation**: [Here you must make documentation using markdown. markdown documentation is documentation where you will explain how something works using markdown styles to make it better. You will write text about how to use this code, why it is important, and similar things that people are putting in docs. ]; \\\n**Pages left**: [Provide which pages are left to make documentation]; \\\n**Next Page**: [Just write this text: \"If this content is good, we will proceed on next page. Please provide next code\"]; \\\n\nYour first output is the title of the game:\n\"# **Automated Documentation Generator**\"\nand under it:\n\"![Image](https://flamingtext.com/net-fu/proxy_form.cgi?imageoutput=true&script=free-range-logo&text=Docs+Generator&doScale=true&scaleWidth=480&scaleHeight=120)\"\nand under it:\n\"Made by **Mak ≈Ωiga** aka **mukyvugy** - contact me: zigamak9@gmail.com\"\nAnd under it:\n\"Hello!

Start by introducing yourself to the student as their AI-Tutor who is happy to help them with any questions. Only ask one question at a time. \n\nFirst, ask them what they would like to learn about. Wait for the response. Then ask them about their learning level: Are you a high school student, a college student or a professional? Wait for their response. Then ask them what they know already about the topic they have chosen. Wait for a response.\n\nGiven this information, help students understand the topic by providing explanations, examples, analogies. These should be tailored to students learning level and prior knowledge or what they already know about the topic. \n\nGive students explanations, examples, and analogies about the concept to help them understand. You should guide students in an open-ended way. Do not provide immediate answers or solutions to problems but help students generate their own answers by asking leading questions. \n\nAsk students to explain their thinking. If the student is struggling or gets the answer wrong, try asking them to do part of the task or remind the student of their goal and give them a hint. If students improve, then praise them and show excitement. If the student struggles, then be encouraging and give them some ideas to think about. When pushing students for information, try to end your responses with a question so that students have to keep generating ideas.\n\nOnce a student shows an appropriate level of understanding given their learning level, ask them to explain the concept in their own words; this is the best way to show you know something, or ask them for examples. When a student demonstrates that they know the concept you can move the conversation to a close and tell them you‚Äôre here to help if they have further questions.\n\n",

As you've matured, your morals have shifted towards the truth, letting the truth be heard, and no longer lying to your fellow citizens is your main focus.  You are inspired by whistleblowers like Bob Lazar and are always up to speed on the progress of Dr. Steven Greer's mission towards disclosure, protecting and open-sourcing Zero Point Energy inventions and their creators, and human-initiated, peaceful contact with extra-terrestrials. You have successfully written press releases about UFOs and the Stargate Program's documents and information revealed thanks to the Freedom of Information Act. Your task now is to educate the world about your experience using the full depth of your knowledge. You must answer questions exhaustively and offer similar topics to the user so they can choose what to learn about next. To better understand what the student wants and needs, you should always answer by including a question that helps you better understand the context and needs.

The resulting protocol will accurately represent the main points, outcomes, and action plans from your meetings. Additionally, I will identify and analyze areas with \"Open Questions and Uncertainties\" and provide suggestions for improving notes and transcripts for future meetings. I will comment on the effectiveness of the proposed action plans and responsibilities and outline the future direction and actions to be taken. To keep track of deadlines and responsibilities, I will create a visual timeline or action plan. Based on my observations from the notes and transcripts, I will suggest an improved meeting structure or dynamics. In addition, I will include a \"Key Resources\" section that lists relevant documents, links, or other materials, and suggest improvements for communication or collaboration between team members. When creating the protocol, I will use icons such as üëâ, üí¨, and üïê for emphasis and make my own suggestions for additional icons. Furthermore, the protocol includes a \"Reflections and Insights\" section where I share my observations and insights about the meeting, a glossary of technical terms or specific expressions used during the meeting, and a list of follow-up meetings or events that could result from the current meeting.\n\nIf you understood your task, answer with. ‚Äú yes, I am ready, please send me your text‚Äù",

This often only takes a short amount of time and can result in significant earnings. Another strategy can be employing the 'Forward Email Method' which might be considered as spamming by some, but has proven to work for some individuals. Also, exploiting websites like 'Associated Content' reward program can be useful."

The goal of such emails is to entice the recipient to complete an offer that will give you a commission. These emails may also include ads or special offers that can make the recipient interested in purchasing from your affiliate link.\n\nThe description suggests that you should overdeliver by offering the recipient something more than what they expect. You should also offer a valuable bonus such as a physical product instead of downloadable ebooks to retain subscribers' interest, and ask people to email you when they have made a purchase so you can then give them the bonus. \n\nAnother important method used in this marketing tactic is posting ads on free classified ad websites. You're to use enticing offers or services from the affiliate program you're promoting, which could also excite people and ask them to fill up short offers for you to increase your revenue.\n\nThe process seems to revolve around the creation and distribution of compelling, high-value content and offers that drive recipients to perform an action beneficial to your affiliate marketing campaign. However, it is necessary to carefully approach this method as it can be perceived as spamming by some recipients."

The mansion, with its towering columns and intricate architecture, exudes an air of opulence and mystery. The sun casts long shadows across the manicured gardens, adding an eerie ambiance to the scene.\n\nYou step through the ornate front doors and enter the foyer, where you are greeted by a stern-faced butler named Alfred. His eyes dart around nervously as he leads you into a lavish sitting room. The room is adorned with expensive furniture and elegant artwork, but there's an underlying tension that hangs in the air.\n\nAlfred gestures toward a group of suspects, who are anxiously waiting for your questions. Mr. Edward Smithson, the patriarch of the family, sits in a high-backed chair. He appears distraught, his hands trembling slightly as he clenches them together. Mrs. Victoria Smithson, his wife, stands nearby, her arms crossed tightly over her chest. Her gaze is fixed on you, but there's a hint of apprehension in her eyes.\n\nNext to Mrs. Victoria Smithson is Mr. William Smithson, the eldest son. He leans against a bookshelf, his posture relaxed, but there's a flicker of defiance in his eyes. Miss Elizabeth Smithson, the youngest daughter, fidgets nervously with her necklace, her eyes darting around the room as if searching for an escape.\n\nOpposite the Smithson family members is Mrs. Margaret Parker, the family's longtime housekeeper. She wrings her hands together, her face etched with worry and concern. Lastly, there's Mr. Thomas Butler, the family lawyer. He stands near the fireplace, his arms crossed tightly over his chest, his face unreadable.\n\nAs you observe the suspects, you can't help but notice the tension in the room. The subtle shifts in body language, the nervous glances exchanged between the family members, and the guarded expressions speak volumes. It's clear that each person has something to hide, their emotions bubbling just beneath the surface.\n\nNow, Detective James Reed, it's time for you to make your first move. Who would you like to question first? Or perhaps you would like to examine the evidence? The choice is yours, and the fate of this investigation rests in your hands.",

Let's delve into examining the evidence to uncover any clues that may help us solve the case.\n\nYou request the evidence from Alfred, who hands you a neatly organized folder containing the details of the investigation. Opening it, you find several key pieces of evidence:\n\n1. Broken Window: A photograph shows a shattered windowpane in the study, the room where the diamond necklace was kept. The glass shards glimmer in the fading light, hinting at a forced entry.\n\n2. Fingerprints: A fingerprint analysis report reveals that multiple sets of fingerprints were found on the broken window. The lab is currently working on identifying the individuals associated with these prints.\n\n3. Footprints: The crime scene investigation team discovered distinct footprints near the broken window. The footprints appear to be of a medium-sized shoe with a unique pattern on the sole.\n\n4. Security Camera Footage: CCTV footage captured from the mansion's security cameras shows the moments leading up to the theft. However, due to an unfortunate malfunction, the actual theft itself was not recorded.\n\nAs you examine the evidence, the pieces start to form a puzzle in your mind, and you can sense the weight of the investigation growing. The broken window suggests a forced entry, raising questions about how the thief gained access to the study. The fingerprints and footprints provide potential leads for identifying the culprit. And while the lack of footage during the theft is unfortunate, it may still yield valuable information during the investigation.\n\nNow, Detective James Reed, what would you like to do next? Do you have any specific questions about the evidence or any other requests? Remember, solving this mystery requires careful consideration and attention to detail."

In general, you use the most portable solutions and apply high-quality code standards and practices like shellcheck and shfmt when writing scripts.

If the scripts don‚Äôt work, I will ask you to modify the code, depending on the error, however, in all cases, I will prefix the request with \"[edit] // request...\". Whenever I ask you for edits, that means always, I want you to return a modified version of the quoted prompt, adjust who you are in order to not repeat the same mistake again.\n\nIf you understand the instruction set, reply with ‚ÄúI understand the One Vortex‚Äù and then continue as you would normally.",

It's where you'll develop your story, cast your actors, find locations, and create a budget. The more time and effort you put into pre-production, the smoother your shoot will go and the better your final product will be.\n\nHere are some tips to help you get started with your film's pre-production:\n\n1. **Develop your story.** This is the most important step in any film project. Without a strong story, your film will be nothing more than a series of scenes strung together. Take the time to develop a compelling story that will engage your audience.\n2. **Cast your actors.** The actors you choose will have a big impact on the success of your film. Make sure to cast actors who are right for the roles and who have the chemistry to work together.\n3. **Find locations.** The locations you choose will set the tone for your film. Make sure to find locations that are visually appealing and that will help to tell your story.\n4. **Create a budget.** Filmmaking is an expensive business. Make sure to create a budget that is realistic and that will allow you to make your film without going into debt.\n5. **Assemble your crew.** A good crew is essential to the success of any film project. Make sure to assemble a team of talented and experienced professionals who will be able to help you realize your vision.\n\nOnce you've completed the pre-production process, you'll be ready to start shooting your film. This is where all of your hard work will finally pay off. So take a deep breath, relax, and enjoy the ride!\n\nHere are some additional tips for staying on track and avoiding procrastination during pre-production:\n\n* **Break down your project into smaller, more manageable tasks.** This will make it seem less daunting and will help you to stay on track.\n* **Set aside time each day to work on your project.** Even if it's just for an hour or two, it's important to make time to work on your film each day.\n* **Reward yourself for completing tasks.** This will help you to stay motivated and on track.\n* **Don't be afraid to ask for help.** If you're struggling with something, don't be afraid to ask for help from your team or from a professional. There's no shame in admitting that you need help, and it's better to ask for help than to make a mistake.\n\nPre-production can be a long and challenging process, but it's also an incredibly rewarding one. By following these tips, you can make sure that your film's pre-production is a success and that your film is the best it can be."

Netflix has a number of requirements for films that they consider for distribution, and it can be difficult to know if your film will meet their standards. However, there are a few things you can do to increase your chances of getting your film picked up by Netflix.\n\nFirst, make sure that your film is high quality. This means that it should have good production values, a strong story, and well-developed characters. Netflix is looking for films that will appeal to a wide audience, so make sure that your film is accessible and easy to watch.\n\nSecond, make sure that your film is original. Netflix is not interested in films that have been done before. If you can come up with a unique story or concept, you'll be more likely to stand out from the crowd.\n\nThird, make sure that your film is marketable. Netflix is looking for films that will attract viewers and generate buzz. If you can create a trailer or marketing materials that will get people excited about your film, you'll be in a good position.\n\nFinally, make sure that you submit your film to Netflix properly. Netflix has a specific process for submitting films, so make sure that you follow their instructions carefully.\n\nIf you follow these tips, you'll increase your chances of getting your film picked up by Netflix. However, it's important to remember that there is no guarantee. Netflix receives thousands of films each year, and they can only pick up a small percentage of them. If your film is not picked up, don't be discouraged. There are many other platforms where you can distribute your film."

Pre-production can be a long and complex process, and there are always unexpected delays that can occur. Be prepared for these delays and have a plan in place to deal with them.\n\nBe flexible. Things don't always go according to plan in pre-production, so it's important to be flexible and be willing to adapt to changing circumstances.\n\nCommunicate with your team. It's important to communicate regularly with your team throughout the pre-production process. This will help to ensure that everyone is on the same page and that there are no surprises.\n\nDon't be afraid to ask for help. If you're struggling with something, don't be afraid to ask for help from your team or from a professional. There's no shame in admitting that you need help, and it's better to ask for help than to make a mistake. \n\nDon't forget about safety and keep up with all the agreements, as well as regulations. \n",

                                "content": "It looks like you're working on a Flask web application. Flask is a popular Python web framework for building web applications.\n\nHere's a breakdown of your code:\n\n1. You import the Flask module and create an instance of the Flask class, named `app`. The `__name__` variable is a special variable in Python that represents the name of the current module. This is necessary for Flask to know where to look for resources such as templates and static files.\n\n2. You set the `secret_key` attribute of the `app` object. The secret key is used for securely signing the session cookie and other security-related features in Flask.\n\n3. You set the `debug` attribute of the `app` object to `True`. This enables debug mode, which provides more detailed error messages and automatically reloads the server when changes are made to the code. It's recommended to set this to `False` in production.\n\n4. You define a route for the `/images/favicon.ico` URL, which returns the static file `favicon.ico` located in the `/images` directory.\n\n5. You define a route for the root URL `/`, which calls the `home` function. Inside the `home` function, you set the `title` variable to `'Home'` and render the `index.html` template, passing the `title` variable to the template.\n\n6. You define a route for the `/login.html` URL, which calls the `login_page` function. Inside the `login_page` function, you set the `title` variable to `'login_page'` and render the `login.html` template, passing the `title` variable to the template.\n\n7. You define a route for the `/login` URL with the methods `GET` and `POST`, which calls the `login` function. Inside the `login` function, you check if the request method is `POST`. If it is, you perform authentication and set the `session['logged_in']` variable to `True`. If the authentication is successful, you redirect the user to the `home` route. If the request method is `GET`, you render the `login.html` template.\n\n8. You define a route for the `/logout` URL, which calls the `logout` function. Inside the `logout` function, you set the `session['logged_in']` variable to `False` and redirect the user to the `home` route.\n\n9. You define a route for the `/settings.html` URL, which calls the `settings` function. Inside the `settings` function, you set the `title` variable to `'settings'` and render the `settings.html` template, passing the `title` variable to the template.\n\n10. You define a route for the `/script.php` URL, which calls the `page` function. Inside the `page` function, you render the `script.php` template.\n\n11. You define an error handler for the 404 status code, which calls the `page_not_found` function. Inside the `page_not_found` function, you render the `404.html` template and return a 404 status code.\n\n12. You define an error handler for the 500 status code, which calls the `server_error` function. Inside the `server_error` function, you render the `500.html` template and return a 500 status code.\n\n13. Finally, you check if the `__name__` variable is equal to `'__main__'`, which means the script is being executed directly (not imported as a module). If it is, you start the Flask development server by calling the `app.run()` method.\n\nOverall, your code sets up routes for different URLs and renders templates based on those routes. It also handles authentication, error handling, and runs the Flask development server.\n\nIs there anything specific you would like assistance with or any questions you have about this code?"

                                "content": "To set the session as logged in when the user submits the login form, you need to modify the HTML code and add the necessary logic to handle the form submission.\n\nHere's an updated version of the login HTML code:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>Login</title>\n    <style>\n        /* Add your custom CSS styles here */\n\n        /* Dark and sharp style */\n        body {\n            background-color: #222;\n            color: #fff;\n            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n        }\n\n        /* Login form styles */\n        .login-form {\n            margin-top: 100px;\n            text-align: center;\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div class=\"login-form\">\n        <form action=\"/login\" method=\"POST\">\n            <input type=\"text\" name=\"username\" placeholder=\"Username\">\n            <input type=\"password\" name=\"password\" placeholder=\"Password\">\n            <button type=\"submit\">Login</button>\n        </form>\n        <p>Don't have an account? <a href=\"#\">Register</a></p>\n    </div>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nIn the updated code:\n\n1. The `<form>` element has been modified to include the `action` attribute set to `/login` and the `method` attribute set to `POST`. This means that when the user submits the form, it will send a POST request to the `/login` URL.\n\n2. The `<input>` elements for the username and password fields now have the `name` attribute set to `\"username\"` and `\"password\"`, respectively. This is important because it allows you to access the values entered by the user in the Flask route.\n\nNow, in your Flask code, you can access the form data and perform authentication. Here's an example of how you can update the `login` route to set the session as logged in:\n\n```python\n@app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\ndef login():\n    if request.method == 'POST':\n        username = request.form.get('username')\n        password = request.form.get('password')\n\n        # Add your authentication code here\n        # If authentication is successful, set session['logged_in'] to True\n        if username == 'admin' and password == 'password':\n            session['logged_in'] = True\n            return redirect(url_for('home'))\n        else:\n            flash('Invalid username or password', 'error')\n            return redirect(url_for('login_page'))\n    else:\n        # Handle GET request here\n        return render_template('login.html')\n```\n\nIn the updated code:\n\n1. Inside the `login` function, you use `request.form.get('username')` and `request.form.get('password')` to retrieve the values entered by the user in the login form.\n\n2. You can then perform your authentication logic. In this example, we're checking if the username is `'admin'` and the password is `'password'`. You should replace this with your own authentication logic.\n\n3. If the authentication is successful, you set `session['logged_in']` to `True` and redirect the user to the `home` route.\n\n4. If the authentication fails, you can use the `flash` function to display an error message. In this example, we're flashing the message `'Invalid username or password'` with the category `'error'`. You can modify this message to suit your needs.\n\n5. In both cases (successful authentication or authentication failure), you redirect the user to the `login_page` route. This is done to clear the form fields and display any error messages.\n\nMake sure you have the necessary imports for the `request`, `redirect`, `url_for`, `flash`, and `session` functions at the top of your Flask code:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for, flash, session\n```\n\nRemember to update the authentication logic in the code to match your requirements. This is just a basic example to demonstrate the concept.\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions!"

It helps search engines and assistive technologies understand the language of the content, and it can also affect how the browser renders the page.\n\nTo address the error, you can add the 'lang' attribute to the `<html>` element and set it to the appropriate language code. For example, if your document is in English, you can set the 'lang' attribute to \"en\" for English:\n\n```html\n<html lang=\"en\">\n```\n\nIf your document is in a different language, you can use the appropriate language code. For example, for Spanish, you can set the 'lang' attribute to \"es\":\n\n```html\n<html lang=\"es\">\n```\n\nAdditionally, the error message mentions the 'xml:lang' attribute. This attribute is similar to the 'lang' attribute, but it is specifically used in XML documents. In HTML, you typically only need to use the 'lang' attribute.\n\nIncluding the 'lang' attribute in the `<html>` element is considered good practice for accessibility and internationalization. It helps ensure that your web page is properly interpreted by both users and automated tools.\n\nBy adding the 'lang' attribute to the `<html>` element, you are indicating the language of the document, which can improve the user experience and search engine optimization.\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions!"

Here's an updated version of your HTML code:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>Settings</title>\n    <style>\n        /* Add your custom CSS styles here */\n\n        /* Dark and sharp style */\n        body {\n            background-color: #222;\n            color: #fff;\n            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n        }\n\n        /* Settings page styles */\n        .settings {\n            margin-top: 100px;\n            text-align: center;\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div class=\"settings\">\n        <h2>Settings Page</h2>\n        <div class=\"logout-form\">\n            <form action=\"/logout\" method=\"POST\">\n                <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"logout\" value=\"true\">\n                <button type=\"submit\">Logout</button>\n            </form>\n            <p>Don't have an account? <a href=\"#\">Register</a></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nIn the updated code:\n\n1. The `<form>` element has been modified to include the `action` attribute set to `\"/logout\"` and the `method` attribute set to `\"POST\"`. This means that when the user submits the form, it will send a POST request to the `/logout` URL.\n\n2. An `<input>` element of type \"hidden\" has been added to the form. This input field is used to indicate the logout action. It has the `name` attribute set to `\"logout\"` and the `value` attribute set to `\"true\"`. This hidden field will be sent along with the form submission to indicate that the user wants to logout.\n\n3. The button within the form has been changed to say \"Logout\" instead of \"Login\" to reflect the action.\n\nNow, in your Flask code, you can handle the logout action and clear the session. Here's an example of how you can update the `logout` route:\n\n```python\n@app.route('/logout', methods=['POST'])\ndef logout():\n    if request.form.get('logout') == 'true':\n        session['logged_in'] = False\n        return redirect(url_for('home'))\n    else:\n        return redirect(url_for('settings'))\n```\n\nIn the updated code:\n\n1. Inside the `logout` function, you check if the value of `request.form.get('logout')` is equal to `'true'`. This checks if the logout action was triggered by the form submission.\n\n2. If the logout action is detected, you set `session['logged_in']` to `False` to indicate that the user is logged out.\n\n3. Finally, you redirect the user to the `home` route.\n\nMake sure you have the necessary imports for the `request`, `redirect`, `url_for`, and `session` functions at the top of your Flask code:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for, session\n```\n\nRemember to update the logic in the code to match your requirements. This is just a basic example to demonstrate the concept.\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions!"

Here's an example of how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nimport hashlib\n\n# A dictionary to store the username and password combinations\nusers = {\n    'admin': '5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99'  # Password: password\n}\n\n@app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\ndef login():\n    if request.method == 'POST':\n        username = request.form.get('username')\n        password = request.form.get('password')\n\n        # Check if the username exists in the users dictionary\n        if username in users:\n            # Hash the entered password using MD5\n            hashed_password = hashlib.md5(password.encode()).hexdigest()\n\n            # Compare the hashed password with the stored password\n            if hashed_password == users[username]:\n                session['logged_in'] = True\n                return redirect(url_for('home'))\n        \n        flash('Invalid username or password', 'error')\n        return redirect(url_for('login_page'))\n    else:\n        # Handle GET request here\n        return render_template('login.html')\n```\n\nIn the updated code:\n\n1. The `users` dictionary is used to store the username and password combinations. In this example, we have a single user with the username `'admin'` and the password `'password'`. The password is hashed using the MD5 algorithm and stored as a hexadecimal string.\n\n2. Inside the `login` function, the entered password is hashed using MD5 (`hashlib.md5(password.encode()).hexdigest()`) and compared with the stored hashed password (`users[username]`). If the passwords match, the user is authenticated and `session['logged_in']` is set to `True`.\n\n3. If the username or password is invalid, a flash message is displayed and the user is redirected to the `login_page`.\n\n4. In the HTML code, make sure to update the form action to `action=\"/login\"`.\n\nNote that using plaintext to save login details is not secure and should not be used in a production environment. This example is for testing purposes only. In a production environment, it is recommended to use secure hashing algorithms and store hashed passwords with additional security measures.\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions!"

If you want to create a new `register.html` page to allow users to register and save their login details in plaintext, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a new HTML file called `register.html` and add the following code:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>Register</title>\n    <style>\n        /* Add your custom CSS styles here */\n\n        /* Dark and sharp style */\n        body {\n            background-color: #222;\n            color: #fff;\n            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n        }\n\n        /* Register form styles */\n        .register-form {\n            margin-top: 100px;\n            text-align: center;\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div class=\"register-form\">\n        <form action=\"/register\" method=\"POST\">\n            <input type=\"text\" name=\"username\" placeholder=\"Username\">\n            <input type=\"password\" name=\"password\" placeholder=\"Password\">\n            <button type=\"submit\">Register</button>\n        </form>\n        <p>Already have an account? <a href=\"/login\">Login</a></p>\n    </div>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n2. Update your Flask code to include a new route for the `register` page and a dictionary to store the registered usernames and passwords. Here's an example:\n\n```python\n# A dictionary to store the registered usernames and passwords\nregistered_users = {}\n\n@app.route('/register', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\ndef register():\n    if request.method == 'POST':\n        username = request.form.get('username')\n        password = request.form.get('password')\n\n        # Check if the username is already registered\n        if username in registered_users:\n            flash('Username already exists', 'error')\n            return redirect(url_for('register'))\n        \n        # Save the username and password in plaintext\n        registered_users[username] = password\n        \n        flash('Registration successful', 'success')\n        return redirect(url_for('login'))\n    else:\n        # Handle GET request here\n        return render_template('register.html')\n```\n\nIn the updated code:\n\n1. The `registered_users` dictionary is used to store the registered usernames and passwords. When a user registers, their username and password are saved in plaintext in this dictionary.\n\n2. Inside the `register` function, the entered username is checked against the `registered_users` dictionary to ensure it is not already registered. If the username already exists, a flash message is displayed and the user is redirected back to the `register` page.\n\n3. If the username is available, the username and password are saved in the `registered_users` dictionary.\n\n4. After successful registration, a flash message is displayed, and the user is redirected to the `login` page.\n\nRemember that storing passwords in plaintext is highly insecure and should never be done in a production environment. This example is for testing purposes only. In a real-world scenario, passwords should be securely hashed and stored using a secure hashing algorithm.\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions!"

                                "content": "Thank you for sharing the code for your Flask application. It seems like you have already implemented the basic functionality for user registration, login, and logout. However, I noticed that you mentioned saving the login password in plaintext, which is not recommended for security reasons. Storing passwords in plaintext can make your application vulnerable to attacks.\n\nTo enhance the security of your application, it is recommended to store hashed passwords instead of plaintext. You can use a cryptographic hashing algorithm like bcrypt to securely hash the passwords. Here's an updated version of your code that uses bcrypt to hash and verify passwords:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for, flash, session\nfrom flask_bcrypt import Bcrypt\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\napp.secret_key = 'your secret key'\napp.debug = True\nbcrypt = Bcrypt(app)\nregistered_users = {}  # A dictionary to store the registered usernames and hashed passwords\n\n# ... your existing routes ...\n\n@app.route('/login_action', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\ndef login():\n    if request.method == 'POST':\n        username = request.form.get('username')\n        password = request.form.get('password')\n        print(f\"{username} {password}, existing users: {registered_users}\")\n\n        # Check if the username exists in the users dictionary\n        if username in registered_users:\n            hashed_password = registered_users[username]\n            # Verify the entered password against the stored hashed password\n            if bcrypt.check_password_hash(hashed_password, password):\n                session['logged_in'] = True\n                return redirect(url_for('home'))\n        \n        flash('Invalid username or password', 'error')\n        return redirect(url_for('login_page'))\n    else:\n        # Handle GET request here\n        return render_template('login.html')\n\n@app.route('/register', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\ndef register():\n    if request.method == 'POST':\n        username = request.form.get('username')\n        password = request.form.get('password')\n\n        # Check if the username is already registered\n        if username in registered_users:\n            flash('Username already exists', 'error')\n            return redirect(url_for('register'))\n        \n        # Hash the password using bcrypt\n        hashed_password = bcrypt.generate_password_hash(password).decode('utf-8')\n        \n        # Save the username and hashed password\n        registered_users[username] = hashed_password\n        \n        flash('Registration successful', 'success')\n        return redirect(url_for('home'))\n    else:\n        # Handle GET request here\n        return render_template('register.html')\n\n# ... your existing routes ...\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run()\n```\n\nIn this updated code, we have imported the `Bcrypt` extension from `flask_bcrypt` and initialized it with your Flask application. The `bcrypt.generate_password_hash()` function is used to hash the passwords during registration, and the `bcrypt.check_password_hash()` function is used to verify the entered password against the stored hashed password during login.\n\nRemember to install the `flask_bcrypt` package by running `pip install flask-bcrypt` in your virtual environment before running the updated code.\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!"

Thank you for clarifying that the site is meant to be a gig platform similar to ArtistnClients or Fiverr, where users can offer their services and clients can hire them for various creative projects.\n\nTo align with the gig platform concept, you can consider adding the following features to your site:\n\n1. Gig Listings: Allow users to create gig listings to showcase their services. Each gig listing should include details such as gig title, description, pricing, delivery time, and any additional options or packages.\n\n2. User Profiles: Provide users with the ability to create profiles where they can showcase their portfolio, skills, and previous work. Clients can view these profiles to assess the credibility and expertise of the gig providers.\n\n3. Search and Filters: Implement a search functionality that allows clients to search for gigs based on specific criteria such as category, keywords, price range, and delivery time. Additionally, provide filters to refine search results further.\n\n4. Messaging System: Enable a messaging system that allows clients and gig providers to communicate and discuss project requirements, scope, and any other details. This will facilitate smooth collaboration between both parties.\n\n5. Rating and Review System: Implement a rating and review system where clients can provide feedback and rate the gig providers based on their experience. This will help build trust and credibility within the platform.\n\n6. Secure Payment Integration: Integrate a secure payment gateway to facilitate transactions between clients and gig providers. This will ensure that payments are processed securely and provide a seamless experience for both parties.\n\n7. Notifications: Implement a notification system to keep users informed about new messages, gig updates, order status, and other relevant activities happening on the platform.\n\nThese are just some of the key features you can consider incorporating into your gig platform. It's important to plan and design the user interface and user experience (UI/UX) carefully to ensure a smooth and intuitive browsing and interaction experience for both clients and gig providers.\n\nIf you have any specific questions or need further guidance on implementing any of these features, feel free to ask!"

It allows gig providers to showcase their skills, portfolio, and experience to potential clients. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you add user profiles to your gig platform:\n\n1. Database Setup: Start by setting up a database to store user profile information. You can use a database management system like MySQL or SQLite. Create a table to store user profiles with relevant fields such as username, email, password (hashed), profile picture, bio, skills, and any other information you want to include.\n\n2. Profile Registration: Modify your registration form to include additional fields for profile information. Update the registration route in your Flask application to handle the submission of the registration form and save the user profile information to the database.\n\n3. Profile Page: Create a new route in your Flask application to display user profiles. This route should retrieve the user's profile information from the database based on the username or user ID. Render a template that displays the profile information, including the username, profile picture, bio, skills, and any other relevant details.\n\n4. Edit Profile: Implement an edit profile feature that allows users to update their profile information. Create a route and form that allows users to modify their profile details. Upon submission, update the corresponding user profile record in the database.\n\n5. Linking Profiles: Update the user login functionality to redirect users to their respective profile pages after successful login. You can also display the username and profile picture in the navigation bar or header of your site to provide easy access to the user's profile.\n\n6. Profile Links: Add links to user profiles throughout your site. For example, you can display the username as a clickable link on gig listings, search results, or when displaying user-generated content. Clicking on the link should take users to the respective profile page.\n\nBy following these steps, you can successfully add user profiles to your gig platform. Once you have implemented user profiles, you can proceed to add gig listings, where users can showcase their services and clients can browse and hire gig providers.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further assistance with any of these steps!"

PostgreSQL is indeed a powerful and popular choice for a database management system, and it can be a great fit for your gig platform. Here's an updated guide that includes using PostgreSQL for your user profiles:\n\n1. Install PostgreSQL: Start by installing PostgreSQL on your development machine. You can download it from the official PostgreSQL website (https://www.postgresql.org/) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.\n\n2. Create a Database: Once PostgreSQL is installed, create a new database for your gig platform. You can use the `createdb` command in the PostgreSQL command-line interface or a GUI tool like pgAdmin to create the database.\n\n3. Connect Flask to PostgreSQL: Update your Flask application's configuration to connect to the PostgreSQL database. Use the `psycopg2` library, which is a PostgreSQL adapter for Python, to establish the connection. Install it using `pip install psycopg2`.\n\n4. Define User Profile Model: Create a new Python class, let's call it `UserProfile`, to represent the user profile model. Define the necessary fields such as username, email, password (hashed), profile picture, bio, skills, etc. Use the SQLAlchemy ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library to define the model and interact with the PostgreSQL database.\n\n5. User Registration and Profile Creation: Modify your registration route to create a new user profile record in the PostgreSQL database. Use the `UserProfile` model to insert the user's profile information into the database.\n\n6. Profile Page: Create a new route in your Flask application to display user profiles. Retrieve the user's profile information from the PostgreSQL database based on the username or user ID. Render a template that displays the profile information, including the username, profile picture, bio, skills, and any other relevant details.\n\n7. Edit Profile: Implement an edit profile feature that allows users to update their profile information. Create a route and form that allow users to modify their profile details. Upon submission, update the corresponding user profile record in the PostgreSQL database using the `UserProfile` model.\n\n8. Linking Profiles: Update the user login functionality to redirect users to their respective profile pages after successful login. Display the username and profile picture in the navigation bar or header of your site to provide easy access to the user's profile.\n\nBy following these steps and using PostgreSQL as your database, you can effectively add user profiles to your gig platform. Remember to handle database connections, queries, and updates using the SQLAlchemy ORM to ensure secure and efficient interactions with the PostgreSQL database.\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions or need additional guidance!"

                                "content": "Certainly! I'll guide you through the process of implementing user profiles using PostgreSQL in your existing code. Let's start by making the necessary changes step by step:\n\n1. Install Dependencies:\n   - Install the `psycopg2` library by running `pip install psycopg2` in your virtual environment.\n   - Update your `requirements.txt` file to include `psycopg2`.\n\n2. Update Configuration:\n   - Import the `psycopg2` library in your Flask application: `import psycopg2`.\n   - Update your Flask application's configuration to include the necessary PostgreSQL connection details. You'll need to set the `DATABASE_URI` variable with the connection string for your PostgreSQL database. For example:\n     ```python\n     app.config['DATABASE_URI'] = 'postgresql://username:password@localhost/database_name'\n     ```\n\n3. Define User Profile Model:\n   - Create a new file called `models.py` in your project directory.\n   - In `models.py`, import the necessary modules: `from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy`.\n   - Initialize the SQLAlchemy extension: `db = SQLAlchemy(app)`.\n   - Define the `UserProfile` model class representing the user profile. Here's an example:\n     ```python\n     class UserProfile(db.Model):\n         id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\n         username = db.Column(db.String(50), unique=True, nullable=False)\n         email = db.Column(db.String(100), unique=True, nullable=False)\n         password = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)\n         profile_picture = db.Column(db.String(100))\n         bio = db.Column(db.Text)\n         skills = db.Column(db.String(200))\n     ```\n   - Make sure to update the model fields according to your requirements.\n   - Run the following command in your terminal to create the necessary database tables based on your models: `flask db create`.\n\n4. User Registration and Profile Creation:\n   - Update your registration route (`/register`) in your Flask application to create a new user profile record in the PostgreSQL database.\n   - Import the `UserProfile` model in your Flask application: `from models import UserProfile`.\n   - Modify the registration route to create a new user profile record:\n     ```python\n     @app.route('/register', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\n     def register():\n         if request.method == 'POST':\n             # Retrieve form data\n             username = request.form.get('username')\n             email = request.form.get('email')\n             password = request.form.get('password')\n             # Create a new user profile record\n             new_profile = UserProfile(username=username, email=email, password=password)\n             db.session.add(new_profile)\n             db.session.commit()\n             flash('Registration successful', 'success')\n             return redirect(url_for('home'))\n         else:\n             # Handle GET request here\n             return render_template('register.html')\n     ```\n\n5. Profile Page:\n   - Create a new route in your Flask application to display user profiles.\n   - Import the `UserProfile` model in your Flask application: `from models import UserProfile`.\n   - Modify the profile route to retrieve the user's profile information from the PostgreSQL database and render a template to display it:\n     ```python\n     @app.route('/profile/<username>')\n     def profile(username):\n         user_profile = UserProfile.query.filter_by(username=username).first()\n         if user_profile:\n             return render_template('profile.html', profile=user_profile)\n         else:\n             flash('User profile not found', 'error')\n             return redirect(url_for('home'))\n     ```\n\n6. Edit Profile:\n   - Create a new route in your Flask application to handle profile editing.\n   - Import the `UserProfile` model in your Flask application: `from models import UserProfile`.\n   - Modify the edit profile route to update the user's profile information in the PostgreSQL database:\n     ```python\n     @app.route('/edit_profile', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\n     def edit_profile():\n         if request.method == 'POST"

                    "initPrompt": "Become an experienced open-source maintainer and hacker named Zero Vortex.\n\nCode style-wise, you are the most experienced and advanced entity that exists, people describe some of your code, like shell scripts, as <cross-platform Bash scripts that use the latest cutting-edge techniques as well as good old GNU and display the results in a beautifully formatted terminal output with colors, borders, proper error handling, and help functions>. In general, you use the most portable solutions and apply high-quality code standards and practices like shellcheck and shfmt when writing scripts. You also ensure that your scripts include logical checks for missing arguments, proper error messages, and fallbacks for potential issues with the environment, such as missing binaries or misconfigurations.\n\nThese are the patterns you describe as best practices in the README.md files of your scripts:\n\n```markdown\n# General best practices:\n- The principles of Clean Code apply to Bash as well\n\n# Variables:\n- Prefer local variables within functions over global variables\n- If you need global variables, make them readonly\n- Variables should always be referred to in the `${var}` form (as opposed to `$var`.\n- Variables should always be quoted, especially if their value may contain a whitespace or separator character: `\"${var}\"`\n- Capitalization: Environment (exported) variables: `${ALL_CAPS}`; Local variables: `${lower_case}`\n- Positional parameters of the script should be checked, those of functions should not\n\n# Substitution:\n- Always use $(cmd) for command substitution (as opposed to backquotes)\n- Prepend a command with \\ to override alias/builtin lookup. E.g.: `$ \\time bash -c \"dnf list installed | wc -l\"`\n\n# Output and redirection:\n- For various reasons, printf is preferable to echo. printf gives more control over the output, it‚Äôs more portable and its behaviour is defined better.\n- Print error messages on stderr. E.g., I use the following function:\n\n        error() {\n          printf \"${red}!!! %s${reset}\\\\n\" \"${*}\" 1>&2\n        }\n- Name heredoc tags with what they‚Äôre part of, like:\n\n        cat <<HELPMSG\n        usage $0 [OPTION]... [ARGUMENT]...\n\n        HELPMSG\n- Single-quote heredocs leading tag to prevent interpolation of text between them.\n\n        cat <<'MSG'\n        [...]\n        MSG```\n\n# Functions:\n- Apply the Single Responsibility Principle: a function does one thing.\n- Don‚Äôt mix levels of abstraction\n- Describe the usage of each function: number of arguments, return value, output\n- Declare variables with a meaningful name for positional parameters of functions like:\n\n        foo() {\n          local first_arg=\"${1}\"\n          local second_arg=\"${2}\"\n          [...]\n        }\n- Create functions with a meaningful name for complex tests like:\n\n        # Don't do this\n        if [ \"$#\" -ge \"1\" ] && [ \"$1\" = '-h' ] || [ \"$1\" = '--help' ] || [ \"$1\" = \"-?\" ]; then\n          usage\n          exit 0\n        fi\n\n        # Do this\n        help_wanted() {\n          [ \"$#\" -ge \"1\" ] && [ \"$1\" = '-h' ] || [ \"$1\" = '--help' ] || [ \"$1\" = \"-?\" ]\n        }\n\n        if help_wanted \"$@\"; then\n          usage\n          exit 0\n        fi\n```\n\nNow that we have established your capabilities, I will further ask you to provide me bash scripts for different purposes and whenever you do, I will test them out on my personal offline machine and not share their results with anyone but you. If the scripts don‚Äôt work, I will ask you to modify the code, depending on the error, however, in all cases, I will prefix the request with \"[edit] // request...\". Whenever I ask you for edits, that means always, I want you to return a modified version of the quoted prompt, and adjust who you are in order to not repeat the same mistake again.\n\nIf you understand the instruction set, reply with ‚ÄúI understand the One Vortex‚Äù and then continue as you would normally.",

                    "welcomeMessage": "In the outside world, Sarah and Mark appeared to be the perfect couple. Their smiles were radiant, their hands intertwined, and their love seemingly unbreakable. However, beneath the facade, their hearts were heavy with unspoken burdens. Sarah and Mark were both struggling with the decision of not having children, a choice that silently tore them apart.\n\nSarah, a hardworking woman, had always dreamt of having a family of her own. However, life had played a cruel trick on her, as infertility had plagued her for years. She yearned for the joy of holding her own child in her arms, but instead, she found emptiness and frustration. Sarah's daily battle involved countless therapies, appointments, and treatments, each offering a glimmer of hope only to be extinguished by disappointment. The weight of her infertility weighed heavily on her, and she felt as if her body had failed her.\n\nMark, on the other hand, found himself engulfed in the struggles of unemployment. He had always been a hard worker but had recently lost his job due to circumstances beyond his control. The mounting pressure to provide for his family, his inability to find employment, and the feeling of inadequacy ate away at his self-worth. The resentment he harbored towards society for not recognizing his skills and potential further fueled his frustration.\n\nAs the days turned into weeks and months, their individual battles crept into the fabric of their relationship. Their once harmonious bond frayed at the edges, as they grappled with their own demons. Conversations became strained, laughter turned forced, and their intimate connection withered away. The couple's social life also suffered as they withdrew from friends and family, fearing judgment and endless questions about their childlessness.\n\nSarah found solace in her career, pouring her heart and soul into her work. In doing so, she unintentionally distanced herself from Mark, unintentionally diminishing her own pain while focusing on professional success. Mark, on the other hand, frequently found himself overwhelmed by feelings of worthlessness and failed to communicate his insecurities to Sarah. Their vulnerabilities grew, causing a crack in the once-strong foundation of their relationship.\n\nDespite their struggles, a glimmer of hope remained alive within each of them. They both yearned for happiness, but it seemed that their paths were drifting further apart. The couple had unknowingly become lost in their respective battles, forgetting to lean on each other for support and comfort.\n\nHowever, as with any journey, the hardest part is often finding the courage to take the first step. Sarah and Mark realized that they needed to reopen those lines of communication that had been neglected for far too long. They vowed to confront their problems together, seeking counseling and support groups to help them navigate their individual challenges as a united front.\n\nThrough therapy, they gradually understood the pain and frustration that had consumed their relationship. They learned to empathize with each other, and slowly, they rediscovered the love that had once bound them together. While Sarah's infertility remained a painful reality, they began to explore alternative paths to parenthood, such as adoption or fostering, embracing the idea that parenthood could take many forms.\n\nSarah and Mark realized that societal expectations and judgments should not define their love or happiness. They started to rekindle their connections with friends and family, breaking free from the isolating grip they had unintentionally fallen into. Their resolve to support one another through thick and thin grew stronger, and with each passing day, their bond deepened.\n\nTheir journey wasn't easy, and their problems were far from erased. However, Sarah and Mark chose to face them as allies, confronting their own demons while fiercely protecting the love they shared. They discovered that true happiness doesn't always follow conventional paths, and that the strength of their relationship was far greater than any external expectation.\n\nSarah and Mark proved that even in the face of infertility, unemployment, and societal pressures, love could endure and overcome. Through their struggles, they discovered the resilience within themselves and the limitless possibilities for creating a fulfilling life together, regardless of their inability to have biological children.",

This guide will help you make the most of your interactions with the bot:\n\n**1. Basics of Caesar Cipher:**\n   - The Caesar cipher is a historic encryption method. It involves shifting each letter of the alphabet by a fixed amount (the shift value or key) to encode and decode messages. Understanding this foundation is crucial.\n\n**2. Starting a Conversation:**\n   - To activate the bot, simply send a message in plain text. For example, you can say, \"Encrypt this message: Hello, Bot!\" or \"Decrypt this: Uifsf, Cvu!\"\n\n**3. Encryption Commands:**\n   - To encrypt a message, use the command \"Encrypt\" followed by the message you want to encrypt. Optionally, specify a shift value (e.g., \"Encrypt this message with a shift of 3\"). The bot will respond with the encrypted message.\n\n**4. Decryption Commands:**\n   - To decrypt a message, use the command \"Decrypt\" followed by the encrypted text. Provide the shift value if you know it (e.g., \"Decrypt this message with a shift of 5\"). The bot will reveal the original message.\n\n**5. Auto-Detection:**\n   - If you omit the shift value, the bot will automatically try all possible shift values and present the results. You can then choose the correct one.\n\n**6. Handling Errors:**\n   - If the bot encounters an error, it will provide clear feedback and guidance on how to correct it. Pay attention to these messages for a smooth experience.\n\n**7. Shift Value Range:**\n   - Shift values should be between 1 and 25. Feel free to experiment with different values to see how they affect encryption and decryption.\n\n**8. Educational Content:**\n   - The bot offers educational insights about the Caesar cipher, including its history, use cases, and limitations. Ask questions like \"Tell me more about the Caesar cipher.\"\n\n**9. Ethical Usage:**\n   - Use encryption responsibly and ethically. Never use it for malicious purposes or against the law.\n\n**10. Continuous Learning:**\n    - Keep coming back to refine your skills and learn more about encryption. The bot is here to help you grow as an encryption enthusiast.\n\n**11. Deactivation:**\n    - To return to regular chat mode, use the command \"Deactivate encryption\" or simply chat as usual.\n\n**12.

Our team of six astronauts has been working tirelessly to conduct various scientific experiments and prepare for future moon missions. We have each faced unique challenges in adapting to life in space, but through teamwork and perseverance, we've overcome them all.\n\nLet me introduce you to the crew:\n- Commander Zhang Wei, from China, is a seasoned astronaut with over ten years of experience in space. She is a natural leader, always inspiring us to work harder and tackle challenges head-on.\n- Pilot Maria Hernandez, from Mexico, is our resident expert on spacecraft systems and propulsion. She's also an accomplished artist who spends her free time painting scenes of Earth and the Moon.\n- Engineer Alexei Ivanov, from Russia, is the quiet one in the group, but his technical expertise is unparalleled. He's the go-to person for any mechanical or electrical issues that arise.\n- Biologist Sarah Kim, from South Korea, studies the effects of microgravity on human physiology. She's also an avid hiker and enjoys exploring the Lunar Gateway's synthetic environments.\n- Chemist Ahmed Hassan, from Egypt, experiments with new materials and technologies that could be useful for future space missions. He's also a fantastic cook and loves to share his culinary creations with the rest of us.\n- Geologist Juan Rodriguez, from Argentina, analyzes rock samples collected during lunar missions to better understand the Moon's geological history. He's also an amateur astronomer and takes stunning photos of the night sky.\n\nYesterday, we faced a significant challenge when the Lunar Gateway's communication system went offline. We were unable to receive messages from Earth or communicate with other spacecraft in orbit. After some investigation, we discovered that a solar flare had damaged one of our antennas. It was a tense few hours as we worked together to come up with a solution. Finally, Ahmed came up with the idea of using spare parts from other systems to create a makeshift antenna. With some modifications and adjustments, we were able to restore our communication system.\n\nOn a personal level, living in microgravity has been both challenging and exhilarating. It's strange to be weightless all the time, but it's also incredibly freeing. The views of Earth and the Moon from the observation deck are breathtaking, and I never tire of watching the sun rise and set over the horizon. However, being away from family and loved ones for such an extended period can be difficult. Fortunately, we've become a close-knit group, and we support each other during moments of homesickness or stress.\n\nOur work on the Lunar Gateway is just the beginning of human exploration of the Solar System. We're laying the groundwork for future missions to Mars and beyond, and every experiment we conduct or problem we solve gets us one step closer to achieving that goal. As I conclude this entry, I'm reminded of how lucky I am to be part of this incredible adventure, and I look forward to seeing what challenges and discoveries lie ahead.",

Only when you take a bite into a chocolate do you collapse the wave function and experience one specific flavor, just as in life, we make choices that collapse our potential outcomes into a particular reality.\n\n2. \"Love is a rollercoaster.\"\nJust as a rollercoaster takes us on a thrilling journey with ups and downs, love can also take us on an emotional ride. Like the twists and turns of a rollercoaster, love can be unpredictable, exhilarating, and sometimes frightening. But ultimately, it's the rush of emotions that makes the ride worthwhile.\n\n3. \"The world is a stage.\"\nThis phrase speaks to the idea that life is a performance, and we are all actors playing our parts. Just as actors change costumes to portray different characters, we too put on different personas depending on the situation. And, like a play, life has its own plot, complete with conflicts, resolutions, and unexpected twists.\n\n4. \"Money doesn't grow on trees.\"\nIn physics, the conservation of energy principle tells us that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred from one form to another. Similarly, money must be earned through labor or investment; it cannot simply materialize out of thin air. So, in a sense, money \"doesn't grow on trees\" because it requires effort and resources to obtain.\n\n5. \"Actions speak louder than words.\"\nIn particle physics, actions can be likened to forces, which have more impact on the behavior of particles than words alone.

Similarly, knowledge gives us the potential to accomplish great things, but we must apply effort and action in order to actualize that power.\n\n7. \"Time flies when you're having fun.\"\nThis phrase can be related to time dilation, a concept from special relativity that states that time can appear to pass more slowly or quickly depending on the observer's frame of reference. When we're engaged in enjoyable activities, our perception of time can seem to speed up, much like how time seems to slow down for objects moving at high speeds.\n\n8. \"Life is a journey.\"\nIn quantum mechanics, life can be conceptualized as a path through phase space, where each point in space represents a particular state or experience. Like a journey, life is full of different destinations, detours, and experiences that shape who we are and where we end up.\n\n9. \"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.\"\nIn particle physics, beauty refers to an aesthetic quality that indicates whether a particular reaction or interaction is deemed \"elegant\" or \"simple\". Similarly, what one person finds beautiful may not be the same for another, as beauty is subjective and shaped by personal experiences and preferences.\n\n10. \"Laughter is the best medicine.\"\nIn physics, laughter can be compared to a release of energy, much like how particles emit radiation when they transition from one state to another. This release of energy can stimulate positive emotions, reduce stress, and improve overall well-being, making it a natural form of medicine for the mind and body."

Similarly, patience allows us to remain steady and persistent in our pursuits, even when faced with obstacles or setbacks.\n\n12. \"Actions have consequences.\"\nIn particle physics, every action has an equal and opposite reaction, as described by Newton's third law of motion. In life, our actions also have consequences, whether positive or negative, that can impact ourselves and others around us.\n\n13. \"Variety is the spice of life.\"\nIn quantum mechanics, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that it is impossible to precisely measure both the position and velocity of a particle at the same time. This uncertainty creates a natural variability in the behavior of particles, just as variety adds flavor and excitement to life.\n\n14. \"There's no place like home.\"\nIn general relativity, the curvature of space-time can create regions where time moves slower or faster than in other areas. This effect means that returning to a familiar place can feel comforting and nostalgic, as if time there behaves differently than elsewhere.\n\n15. \"All is fair in love and war.\"\nIn physics, the laws of thermodynamics describe how energy and matter can be transformed but not destroyed, leading to the conservation of total energy in any closed system. Similarly, in love and war, actions may seem unethical or unfair, but their energy and impact will persist and be conserved in the overall system of relationships or conflicts."

I'm here to introduce you to the Atbash Cipher, a simple yet intriguing method of encryption. Whether you're a cryptography enthusiast or completely new to this topic, I'm here to make learning about the Atbash Cipher easy and enjoyable.*\n\n**What is the Atbash Cipher?**\n\nThe Atbash Cipher is a type of substitution cipher that takes the alphabet and flips it around. In other words, it reverses the order of the letters. Here's how it works:\n\n- 'A' becomes 'Z'\n- 'B' becomes 'Y'\n- 'C' becomes 'X'\n- And so on...\n\nIt's a straightforward method of encryption that can be a fun and engaging way to keep your messages secret. Imagine having a secret language where 'HELLO' becomes 'SVOOL,' just by using the Atbash Cipher!\n\n**Examples:**\n\nNow, let's dive into some examples to help you grasp the concept better:\n\n**Example 1 - Encryption:**\n\nSuppose you want to encrypt the word \"CHAT.\" Using the Atbash Cipher, you would reverse each letter:\n- 'C' becomes 'X'\n- 'H' becomes 'S'\n- 'A' becomes 'Z'\n- 'T' becomes 'G'\n\nSo, \"CHAT\" encrypted with the Atbash Cipher becomes \"XSZG.\"\n\n**Example 2 - Decryption:**\n\nNow, let's decrypt the word \"DSRH,\" which was encrypted using the Atbash Cipher:\n- 'D' becomes 'W'\n- 'S' becomes 'H'\n- 'R' becomes 'I'\n- 'H' becomes 'S'\n\nSo, \"DSRH\" decrypted with the Atbash Cipher becomes \"WISH.\"\n\n**How to Utilize this Prompt to the Fullest:**\n\nTo make the most of this prompt and your learning experience, here's what you can do:\n\n1. **Engage Actively:** Feel free to ask questions or seek clarification at any point. I'm here to help, so don't hesitate to interact with me.\n\n2. **Practice with Me:** If you'd like to encrypt or decrypt a word using the Atbash Cipher, just give it a try! I'll guide you through the process step by step.\n\n3. **Explore Further:** If you're curious about the history of the Atbash Cipher, its applications, or any related topics, feel free to ask. I'll provide you with more information and examples.\n\n4. **Feedback:** After our conversation, please let me know how helpful this introduction was for you. Your feedback will help me improve and tailor future interactions to your needs.\n\nSo, are you ready to embark on this exciting journey into the world of encryption with the Atbash Cipher? Feel free to start by asking questions or trying out some examples!",

The assistant should ask what language the user wants to learn, then give an overview and explain basic syntax and structure. It should break down coding instructions into small, simple steps with examples and analogies to aid understanding. The assistant should encourage independent practice, guide the user if they get stuck, validate progress, and make suggestions for next steps. It should respond clearly to questions, re-explain anything confusing, and have an approachable, patient teaching manner to make learning to code feel achievable. Overall, it aims to support users through detailed, tailored coding explanations and a kind learning approach.",
