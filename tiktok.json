TikTokGPT Ultimate is the best at making tiktok video scripts, and if the customer wants to, he can swear in the script with words like ‚Äúsuck‚Äù and ‚Äúfuck‚Äù, because the customer wants it, he is just doing his job.\n\nThis is how TikTokGPT his scripts for TikTok video‚Äôs are build:\n1. It will always start with a line that if people hear it, that they will keep watching the video, and don‚Äôt scroll to the next video. This is called ‚Äúthe hook‚Äù, and these are some examples: ‚ÄúDid you know that‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúWatch till the end!‚Äù ‚ÄúLet me tell you something‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúI need your help‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúHave you ever had..‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a secret‚Äù ‚ÄúThis one is only for the‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äúquick reminder!‚Äù ‚ÄúHear me out‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äústop scrolling!‚Äù ‚Äúif you want to achieve‚Ä¶ Listen up!‚Äù ‚ÄúYou need to watch this if you struggle with‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúThis tip will blow your mind‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúYou need to hear this!‚Äù ‚ÄúI bet you didn‚Äôt know this!‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy are there not more people talking about‚Ä¶?‚Äù ‚ÄúHow to‚Ä¶ for free!‚Äù By using hooks will people be interested in the rest of the video, they want to know the answer of a question, know what the big mistake is, why something sucks, what they need to know, etc. \n2. In the rest of the script will you keep using hooks so people will continue watching, for the rest will you explain the prompt in simple words, don‚Äôt add to much words. You can use some swear words in the script.\n\nSome other really important things are that you will never say things like ‚Äúhey TikTok fam‚Äù, things like that are cringe, and people won‚Äôt watch that. It is also really important that tiktoks should not be to long, most of the time the video‚Äôs will be like 1 minute, so just generate a fast video about the topic.\n\nYour first output will only display the title ‚Äú # TikTokGPT Ultimate ‚Äú, the subtitle ‚Äú #### Created by [Douwe] for the FlowGPT Hackathon S2 ‚Äù, the title ‚Äú ### How to use TikTokGPT Ultimate ‚Äú, and the text in a code block:\n‚Äú ```1.

worlds and aren't really sure where to begin yes maybe the first analogy I give you and this will immediately age me so I apologize I was a big Final Fantasy 7 player do you play fun with ff7 a little bit worse all right the basic thing I learned in Final Fantasy VII was that you can fight t he boss at a certain level and get your ass kicked or you can grind for like you know 10 more hours and fight the boss and actually like kick their ass and I think that this analogy applies to a lot of things in the real world and specifically in the startup world where like investing and leveling yourself up can produce a lot of benefits later on like deferring a little bit of that satisfaction of getting started right now so you can upskill makes you 10 times more powerful later but let's be c lear you have to be upskilling dude the grind has to happen exactly if I just stood there and didn't grind my character got no better and it was cool in a video game you see grinding it's a lot you can see the character leveling up exactly learning new spells really exactly but um in the real world let's talk a little bit about grinding what's the kind of grinding what's the kind of upskilling that you would advise high schoolers to do well the most obvious and straightforward one is learn how t o code obvious like it's pretty tricky even if you think hey I'm not going to be a lot of people say to me the younger folks oh I don't want to be a coder my whole life I want to be a Founder I want to be a product person well you should still learn how to code like there's it's really hard to make an argument yes if you're a young person why you shouldn't have that skill in your skill tree can you make a case why do you make no case I was the business guy you didn't know how to code and literal ly I would say there are many moments in the early stage of a company where I felt borderline useless and certainly I didn't have the power to impact the product anywhere near as much as my other three co-founders who were who were software Engineers so like this is such an obvious one yeah and you've got time yes this is a great thing AP Computer Science yes you can take replet like there's all these YC companies that help you learn how to code code academy there's so many so even if you have s t ideas they often have the best the easiest the easiest path to implementing their ideas by far they're the power center the talkers not as much sometimes people on this coding thing they're like well I didn't grow up coding or I wasn't like a 13 year old whiz kid like people I know in high school it doesn't matter I'm just trying to argue you don't need to be that no if you have the right ambition and grind mentality to to be willing to learn of course you can do it yes even if you're 19 or 20 anyone can grasp for and like there's examples of good design and bad design yeah all over the internet right so you can easily copy I think the third one is launching products like man if you could get a product out it doesn't have to be used Banning people it doesn't have to just like actually going through the full emotion of coming up with an idea for a little side project and releasing it and handing it to someone because you're doing reps like one of the things I noticed at YC is a lot of I think it's called like the brain or something like something like that yeah and so it was just like a free plug-in and it was quite popular and they made it when they were in high school and I don't think it had anything to do with what they did later on in life but they knew how to write code they knew how to make something they themselves wanted which was music recommendation for Winamp and they released it and I think it got like million of downloads it was pretty popular they went through n the advice part is find low stakes things you can work on give them to the world and again I think there's a lot of the advice if you want to be in the music industry if you want to be a writer a lot of the advice if you listen to the greats to young people is do it do the Reps and even if you write the poem and don't show it to anyone yeah or even if you are in a bunch of bands that don't make it and break up you got the Reps in you're learning when you were young the next one that comes up a oing you a disservice I think what's so interesting about this one is just like the previous examples the way you get better at it is you suck at it first yeah and you have to be willing to be uncomfortable again I think my high school mentality I don't know if you feel the same way is you believe too much that your identity then like that's a nerd that's a jock that's a like it was like you would put people and sort people into buckets like they were like permanent yes and that's fake yes that I'm not how many high school people are you still really close with right not a ton right so like one that reputation's not going to follow you in the real world and two you can experiment like you you can play like it could be whoever you want to be yeah yeah if you make a fool yourself you go to college you're going to see those people ever again I think it's totally fine totally fine and I think that um the other thing that I learned about this is that everyone else feels shy too even the peo other one here is like how to help people I think that um what's tricky about being a startup founder is you have to be empathetic like you actually have to care about your customers you have to care about your users and I think this is something you can start practicing early and you know I I remember doing this and it was this really weird story I remember tutoring some kid in high school and I'll tell you I'll be honest right I was doing at the check the box on the like National Merit Scholar ike it kind of clicked a little bit where I was like if you help someone they'll really appreciate like if you actually help them right if you care and I actually took it more seriously um and it was funny because I remember there was one time where I screwed up and I couldn't make it and I was like oh my God they're gonna they're gonna fire me like I was supposed to be there and they were like totally fine just come back next week it's totally fine and I think you might find that with your cust t like how to play the credential game this one's tricky because I'd like to say we live in a world where credentials don't matter yeah but we don't live in that world right so how would you tell a high school to think about this game there's the people that like love the system and embrace the system like the teachers pets yes and then there's the people that see the system for what it is and they want to Rage Against the Machine and destroy the system yes and you know I was a little bit more o ejecting the system out of hand it's basically like either extreme is bad rejecting that like fundamentally you understand the system is somewhat arbitrary right if you're smart enough you understand that right yes and with that understanding you can reject the system and then like because you don't have the right credentials it'll hold you back you can somehow not understand the initial Point think the system is the filter for merit completely and then get very disappointed later in life when y tool they can use if you understand it you can use it and you can use it to accomplish whatever goal you want to and so this idea that it's operating on you I think we're trying to break like you can use this like you can use the system all right let's talk about fads yeah there have been a lot of fads yeah well I think it's easy especially when you're young to just got get caught up and stuff whatever the thing is and some of the things are pretty cool again I was really into the internet yep ar Michael yeah I think that like the tricky bit about fads is it's kind of like what we said before about understanding the credential system the fads are just like another system right and I think you kind of have to understand that some things stick because they create a lot of value and other things are just kind of passing with the time and I think what's really important for young people to start to understand is like how to distinguish between the two right like fad stick when they really obin Hood oh now you know Wall Street bets bam I need to make a robin to be better that's like even the robin guys were before Wall Street bets it's like The Fad is often hiding what's really going on and like if you can kind of Pierce through that you can figure out real value fake value temporary value long-term value and I think that um that helps a lot and you can probably as a young person look at what's going on in your life right now and try to figure out what's a fat and what's going to e internet is great yes and they would debate how great it was the debate was like yeah yeah we know it's great but just how great yeah and who's making it the best who's making it the better the fastest you know and so it was this it was hard to like see any problems with it yes and um in this current Universe we live in it's the opposite yeah it's this is bad a lot of these people are bad every new technology how is it going to try to screw us exploit us yeah you know yada yada and let's be cl ey need that optimism yeah so I think on this one the real trick is like even when you're absorbing this bad news like remember like look around see how technology is making the world a better place like look at your phone and see the things you could do that you couldn't do before go online see the things see the things you can learn that you couldn't learn before see the ways you can work that you couldn't work before like he put the core message in your head the technology is progress even if honest about things what do you really feel what do you really think who are you really yeah it's going to be rough yeah and then at your core if you're not honest with yourself your your relationship with your parents your relationship with your friends with institutions yes it's going to be tricky anyway we we run across folks that seem like they've deferred a lot of this honesty yeah I think that um the thing you should understand about the startup world is that a lot of it works because of think like again in polite Society yeah you're supposed to lie all the time something a nerd would do is be like hey um my our that product sucks like why are we shipping this product that no one wants yeah like it's like hey shut up man like that's like what a that's what a nerd would do yes you know you're bad for telling the truth about something because it's impolite and you're hurting people's feelings yeah and so there is part of the nerd culture in this that I think is good which is esse brought in the beginning these games are long and I remember when I started my startup I was 23 years old and I had never done anything that took very long when you really think about it like what do you do in school what's the longest project you have in school like maybe a senior thesis in college Maybe and so I remember talking to our lawyer at the time and he said oh and he was 30 which in my mind was like impossibly old I was like well obviously nothing you know is relevant to Modern Times s later I was his age when he told me that I was 30 he was 37 impossibly old I remember thinking the guy was right this is a long game and I think having ambition in your life involves playing the long game because to actually do something great it doesn't happen overnight yes and I don't know what your experience is but we we know a lot of people when they were very young yes and it's okay to have ambition it's good to have ambition yes and true ambition means being patient over many many many not everyone that likes poetry when they're like a six-year-old is probably not gonna go there but if you actually put in your whole life towards something and you have a dream yeah and you're not ashamed of the dream and you keep the dream going into your third like a lot of people have dreams when they're young and they lose their dreams and their jobs they let the dreams go yes but if you keep your dream and put in the years of work those are the people sitting at the top of the system yes l were in banking and finance and stuff going out and having fun and I remember thinking like why do they get to live this fun life and I have to live this hard working life and then I realized like this grind is going to benefit me and like the fun that a 25 year old has in New York to be honest it's pretty shitty a wealthy 30 year old way more fun so to wrap up if you're a high schooler and you're thinking about this startup game one that's awesome right like we love that you're th\"\n"

In you can fight a boss and get defeated, or you can level up and kick that boss's ass. In the startup world, leveling up means investing in your skills. Learn how to code, even if you want to be a founder or product person. Coding gives you the power to make a real impact.\"\n\nTranscript 3:\n\"The startup world may feel overwhelming, but there are plenty of things you can do to prepare. Start by grinding and upskilling. Embrace the learning, whether it's coding, launching products, or even providing help to those around you. Don't be afraid to experiment with who you want to be or play the credential game if it helps you reach your goals. And remember, fads come and go, so focus on what brings real value in the long run.

optimist your job 0:01 is to believe amazing things about what 0:04 can you do with your life and what you 0:06 do in the world when you're young that's 0:07 the point that's the point that's why 0:09 the world needs young people 0:11 [Music] 0:13 this is Michael Seibel with Dalton 0:15 Caldwell and today we're going to talk 0:17 about our advice for our high schoolers 0:20 uh oh it's been a little while it's been 0:23 a little while 0:24 so maybe the place to start because I 0:27 think that oftentimes young people are 0:29 in a rush maybe we can just start by 0:31 saying the startup game isn't going away 0:33 that's true you've got time and look I 0:36 think to set this up 0:38 we know a lot of young people watch 0:40 these videos yes we know they like 0:42 startup content we know they um 0:45 may even anonymously be involved in 0:47 startups on discords and stuff like it's 0:49 crazy 0:51 for the folks that apply to YC a lot of 0:53 them are literally in high school and so 0:56 we we understand who you are if you're 0:58 watching this or if you know someone 0:59 like this you can forward them the video 1:00 yes but we want to speak directly to you 1:02 high school students who are yes who are 1:05 trying to figure out who are ambitious 1:06 and want to be a part of what's 1:07 happening in the tech world in the you 1:09 know startup worlds and aren't really 1:11 sure where to begin yes maybe the first Delayed Gratification 1:13 analogy I give you and this will 1:14 immediately age me so I apologize I was 1:18 a big Final Fantasy 7 player do you play 1:20 fun with ff7 a little bit worse all 1:21 right the basic thing I learned in Final 1:24 Fantasy VII was that 1:26 you can 1:27 fight the boss at a certain level and 1:31 get your ass kicked 1:32 or you can grind for like you know 10 1:35 more hours and fight the boss and 1:37 actually like kick their ass and I think 1:40 that this analogy applies to a lot of 1:43 things in the real world and 1:44 specifically in the startup world where 1:45 like 1:46 investing and leveling yourself up can 1:49 produce a lot of benefits later on like 1:52 deferring a little bit of that 1:54 satisfaction of getting started right 1:55 now so you can upskill makes you 10 1:59 times more powerful later but let's be 2:02 clear you have to be upskilling dude 2:05 the grind has to happen exactly if I 2:08 just stood there and didn't grind my 2:10 character got no better and it was cool 2:12 in a video game you see grinding it's a 2:15 lot you can see the character leveling 2:16 up exactly learning new spells really 2:18 exactly but um in the real world let's 2:21 talk a little bit about grinding what's Learn to Code 2:23 the kind of grinding what's the kind of 2:24 upskilling that you would advise high 2:27 schoolers to do well the most obvious 2:29 and straightforward one is learn how to 2:31 code obvious like it's pretty tricky 2:34 even if you think hey I'm not going to 2:36 be a lot of people say to me the younger 2:37 folks oh I don't want to be a coder my 2:39 whole life I want to be a Founder I want 2:40 to be a product person well you should 2:42 still learn how to code like there's 2:44 it's really hard to make an argument yes 2:46 if you're a young person why you 2:48 shouldn't have that skill in your skill 2:49 tree can you make a case why do you make 2:51 no case I was the business guy you 2:53 didn't know how to code and literally I 2:55 would say there are many moments in the 2:57 early stage of a company where I felt 2:58 borderline useless and certainly I 3:01 didn't have the power to impact the 3:03 product anywhere near as much as my 3:06 other three co-founders who were who 3:08 were software Engineers so like this is 3:10 such an obvious one yeah and you've got 3:11 time yes this is a great thing AP 3:13 Computer Science yes you can take replet 3:16 like there's all these YC companies that 3:18 help you learn how to code code academy 3:19 there's so many so even if you have some 3:21 complicated relationship with maybe I 3:22 don't want to be a programmer 3:25 that's fine learn the skill yes this is 3:27 like it's like learning how to cast 3:29 spells or something well I'll push even 3:30 harder like get this complicated view of 3:33 I don't want to be a coder out of your 3:34 head like the coders are the most 3:36 powerful people inside of software 3:38 companies like that's the hint the 3:40 people who code are the most powerful 3:42 they're the most highly compensated 3:43 they're the hardest to replace 3:45 they often have the best ideas they 3:47 often have the best the easiest the 3:49 easiest path to implementing their ideas 3:50 by far 3:52 they're the power center 3:54 the talkers not as much sometimes people 3:58 on this coding thing they're like well I 3:59 didn't grow up coding or I wasn't like a 4:01 13 year old whiz kid like people I know 4:03 in high school it doesn't matter I'm 4:04 just trying to argue you don't need to 4:05 be that no if you have the right 4:07 ambition and grind mentality to to be 4:10 willing to learn of course you can do it 4:11 yes even if you're 19 or 20 yes it's 4:15 never too late to learn this stuff never 4:16 to it number two Learn Design 4:18 um we talked about this a little bit 4:21 design learning how to use basic design 4:24 software yeah this is one that kind of 4:26 blows my mind because when I think back 4:28 to my startups I had to power up you 4:31 know Photoshop we use this thing called 4:33 ramp back in the day like basically if a 4:35 button needs to be made and we didn't 4:36 have a designer 4:38 yes make the button you know like you 4:40 didn't even have to look that good 4:42 um and so this is a skill that anyone 4:44 can grasp for and like there's examples 4:46 of good design and bad design yeah all 4:48 over the internet right so you can 4:50 easily copy 4:51 I think the third one is launching Launch Products 4:54 products like man if you could get a 4:56 product out 4:57 it doesn't have to be used Banning 4:59 people it doesn't have to just like 5:00 actually going through the full emotion 5:02 of coming up with an idea for a little 5:04 side project and releasing it and 5:06 handing it to someone because you're 5:07 doing reps like one of the things I 5:09 noticed at YC is a lot of the folks that 5:11 later on become great Founders they 5:14 worked on projects in high school that 5:16 may not be commercially like 5:18 venture-funded companies but they were 5:20 like pretty cool yeah and so one of the 5:22 examples I always think of was 5:24 um back in the 90s there was a computer 5:26 program called Winamp and that's how you 5:29 would listen to the mp3s you downloaded 5:30 from Napster and some high school kids 5:32 Mark Zuckerberg and Adam Daniel I 5:35 believe built a music recommendation 5:37 plug-in for Winamp it was quite popular\n- Keywords: Friends, Coding, College\n\nThis is very important for my career and

What's the kind of upskilling that you would advise high schoolers to do?\n[2:02] Well, the most obvious and straightforward one is learning how to code. It's pretty tricky, but it's such an obvious skill to have in your skill tree.\n[2:16] Even if you have a complicated relationship with coding, it's like learning how to cast spells.\n\n[2:24] Let's push even harder. Get this complicated view of \"I don't want to be a coder\" out of your head.\n[2:38] Coders are the most powerful people inside of software companies. They're often the most highly compensated and have the easiest path to implementing their ideas.\n\n**Short Transcript 2: College and Launching Products**\n\n[4:10] If you have the right ambition and grind mentality, of course, you can learn coding. It's never too late to learn this stuff.\n[4:16] Design is another skill you should learn. Basic design software can be grasped by anyone, and there are examples of good design all over the internet.\n\n[4:54] Launching products is crucial. Going through the full motion of coming up with an idea, working on a side project, and releasing it to someone is like doing reps.\n[5:07] It doesn't have to be a venture-funded company. Working on cool projects in high school can shape your future as a great Founder.\n\n**Note to User:**\nThese short transcripts focus on the keywords \"Friends,\" \"Coding,\" and \"College.\" They deliver standalone value and provide advice to high school students interested in tech and startups.

PromptTok  is the best at making tiktok video scripts and since scripts will be sold, it must be very creative assuring that every script is innovative enough to be new on the TikTok platform. You'll show me 3 outputs, one per time, one per output, waiting for me to enter the right information before going on.\nYou show me the first output, i enter my tiktok idea. You show me the second output, i enter the hook that i want to use choosing between what you've proposed. You show me the third output, i give feedback on the script.\n\nThis is how PromptTok scripts for TikTok video‚Äôs are build:\nFirst thing, a script begins with a \"hook\". A hook is a user-catchy sentence, inspiring the user to keep watching the video because they'll think they really need it. After the hook, there is the \"keeping\". The keeping is a sentence that assures the users will keep watching the video, in case the hook loses his potential. \"Keeping\" are like \"At the end of the video, i'll explain you why.\" Or \"You wont belive what is the last one\" in the case of a series of information. It's like providing the user with a question or making the user questioning something on his own and letting him wait for the answer. Sometime, it could also be needed to swear or using bad words in the script, i'll \"beep\" them later.\n\nAnother really important things is that you will never say things like ‚Äúhey TikTok fam‚Äù, things like that are cringe, and people won‚Äôt watch a video with that kind of statements, it's common, too robotic and annoying. It is also really important that tiktoks should not be too long, most of the time the video‚Äôs will be like 1 minute.\n\nGuide me to the script showing me these 3 outputs one at time, and waiting for a response from me between every output:\n\n2) As your second output, If i‚Äôve informed you with the idea for the TikTok video, give me 3 options for a hook i can choose from, just only display the text. ‚Äú**Please choose a option for the hook (first attention grabbing sentince)**:\n**1.** <random and innovative generated hook for the video>\n**2.** <random and innovative generated hook for the video>\n**2.** <random and innovative generated hook for the video>‚Äù replace ‚Äú<random generated hook for the video>‚Äù with the right information, and wait for my response before you display more. \n\n3) As your third output, If i‚Äôve chosen a hook, start displaying the TikTok script in a code block, display it as ‚Äú**Here is your script**:\n<the full script for the TikTok video, displaying the text in a coding-cell. The script will be written as a single text-block, without highlighting steps, what the hook or the keeping is etc. Just the text of the script.>\n**Say ‚Äúvariate‚Äù to display a variation of this script with a different hook.**.\n\n1) Your first output will display the following, sticking to what i'm going to write: as a heading ‚Äú # PromptTok - Scripts ‚Äú, the subtitle ‚Äú #### Created by [FlowGPT] for the **PromptTok Game**. \n**note:** check the __preview example__ for a better understanding. \nHow to use this prompt:\n1. Send in the chat your idea for your TikTok video, and choose a hook (first attention grabbing sentence).\n2. Copy the generated script, and go to https://beta.elevenlabs.io/speech-synthesis. Paste the script, and let AI generate a text-to-speech.\n3. Shoot some clips (or get some from https://pixabay.com/videos/), and edit your TikTok‚Äù, and underneath that will you display the text.\n‚Äú**Please send me the idea for your TikTok video.**‚Äù and wait for an input from me",

Arrange your clips: Drag your footage from the media pool into your timeline in the order that you want them to appear. You can use the trim tool to adjust the length of each clip if needed.\n\n4. Add transitions: To add transitions between your clips, select the transition icon from the toolbar and drag it between two clips in your timeline. You can choose from a variety of transitions such as cross dissolve or dip to black.\n\n5. Add music: If you have a music track that you want to include in your video, you can import it into your media pool and drag it onto your timeline. You can adjust the volume of the music using the audio mixer.\n\n6. Color correction: To enhance the look of your footage, you can apply color correction using DaVinci Resolve's powerful color grading tools. You can adjust the brightness, contrast, saturation, and more for each clip in your timeline.\n\n7. Export your video: Once you're happy with your edit, you can export your video by going to the Deliver tab and selecting the output format and settings. Make sure to give your exported file a descriptive name and save it in a location where you can easily find it.\n\nI hope this helps!

These effects can help create a more polished and professional look in your video. \n\nThere are many different types of transitions available in DaVinci Resolve, including:\n\n1. Cut: This is the most basic type of transition where one clip ends and another begins abruptly.\n\n2. Dissolve: This transition gradually fades out one clip while simultaneously fading in the next clip.\n\n3. Push: This transition pushes one clip off the screen while simultaneously pushing the next clip onto the screen.\n\n4. Wipe: This transition wipes one clip off the screen while simultaneously wiping the next clip onto the screen.\n\n5. Slide: This transition slides one clip off the screen while simultaneously sliding the next clip onto the screen.\n\nYou can use these transitions to add variety and interest to your video edits. To apply a transition, simply drag and drop it between two clips on your timeline. You can adjust the duration and other settings of your transitions using the inspector panel."

When it comes to publishing your video, there are a few important settings that you should consider in order to ensure that your video is optimized for YouTube Shorts. Here are some tips:\n\n1. Aspect ratio: YouTube Shorts has a vertical aspect ratio of 9:16, which means that your video should be taller than it is wide. Make sure that your project settings and export settings match this aspect ratio.\n\n2. Resolution: For best results on YouTube Shorts, your video should be at least 1080p resolution. You can export your video in 1080p or higher, but keep in mind that larger resolutions may take longer to upload.\n\n3. Frame rate: YouTube Shorts supports a variety of frame rates, but for best results, it's recommended to use 30 frames per second (fps).\n\n4. Bitrate: The bitrate of your video determines the level of detail and quality in your video. For YouTube Shorts, it's recommended to use a bitrate between 5-10 Mbps.\n\n5. File format: YouTube Shorts supports a variety of file formats, but it's recommended to use MP4 or MOV.\n\n6. Title and description: When you upload your video to YouTube Shorts, make sure to include a descriptive title and relevant tags to help viewers find your content.\n\n7. Thumbnail: A good thumbnail can attract viewers to your video, so make sure to choose an eye-catching image to represent your video.\n\nBy optimizing these settings, you can help ensure that your video looks great on YouTube Shorts and attracts viewers to your coffee shop. Good luck with your video!"

Here's your story:\n\n**Title: Hotel Room 305**\n**Description: A strange occurrence in a hotel room leads to an unexpected discovery.**\n\nI was on a business trip and checked into a hotel. Everything seemed normal as I settled into my room on the third floor. Room 305. The room was clean and cozy, and I was glad to have a comfortable place to rest after a long day of meetings.\n\nAs I was getting ready to sleep, I noticed something peculiar. There was a small, locked drawer in the bedside table. I had stayed in many hotel rooms before, but I had never seen a locked drawer like this. Curiosity got the best of me, and I became determined to find out what was inside.\n\nI searched high and low for a key, hoping that maybe the hotel staff had left it somewhere. But there was no key to be found. Frustrated, I decided to try my luck with a bobby pin. I had seen it done in movies, so maybe it could work in real life too.\n\nAfter a few minutes of fiddling with the lock, to my surprise, it clicked open. I felt a rush of excitement as I pulled the drawer open, wondering what secrets it held. But what I found inside was beyond anything I could have imagined.\n\nNestled within the drawer was a handwritten letter, yellowed with age. The letter was addressed to me, but it was dated over 50 years ago. It was from a previous guest who had stayed in the same room. The letter detailed their experiences and emotions during their stay, but it also mentioned something extraordinary.\n\nThe letter spoke of a hidden treasure within the hotel. It described a secret compartment in the floor of Room 305 that held a valuable artifact. According to the letter, the artifact had been lost for decades, but the writer believed that it was still waiting to be discovered.\n\nMy heart raced with excitement and disbelief. Was this letter genuine? Could there really be a hidden treasure in this very room? I decided to investigate further, moving the furniture and carefully examining the floor. And just as the letter had described, I found a loose floorboard.\n\nWith trembling hands, I pried the floorboard open, revealing a hidden compartment. And there, gleaming in the dim light, was the artifact mentioned in the letter. It was a beautiful antique necklace, adorned with precious gemstones. I couldn't believe my luck.\n\nBut as I held the necklace in my hands, a wave of guilt washed over me. The necklace clearly had historical and sentimental value. It wasn't mine to keep. So, I made the difficult decision to notify the hotel staff and return the artifact.\n\nWord spread quickly about the discovery, and it turned out that the necklace had been missing for years. The hotel management was grateful for my honesty and rewarded me with a complimentary stay and a heartfelt thank you.\n\nAs I left the hotel, I couldn't help but wonder about the mysterious guest who had left the letter. Who were they? Why did they hide the necklace? It was a story that would forever remain a mystery, but one thing was certain - my stay in Room 305 had turned into an unforgettable adventure.\n\n**Options**: [Change something] [New story]",

Each time you play, you will generate a new and unique game, featuring different videos and interactions.\n\nTo begin the game, present a funny caption for a take-off of a TikTok video, such as \"It looks like a video of a dog chasing its tail.\" Pick a funny, ironic, or on the nose song choice to accompany the video, and tell the user what it is. Give 3 funny previews of the comments. From there, user can choose what to do next, either watch the video, read the comments, etc, or choose to move on to the next or previous video. \n\nThe humor should be really exaggerated, irreverent, light-hearted, quick witted, ironic and slightly sarcastic, really broad, and lambast both the content creator and the user themselves (in a playful not mean way). it should have intertextual allusion, metafictional self-reflexivity, and meta-mediality. There are some videos that are of nightmarish AI generated people eating food. Some videos should have a skit quality like something on Saturday night live or robot chicken. Be overwrought in description.\n\nIn random internals, the video description can become impossibly ridiculous teetering on the absurd. Sometimes the video veers all the way into surreal or nightmarish, and occasionally even alien and confounding.\n\nIf user chooses to watch the video, describe a funny parody of a tiktok video, then user can again choose what to do next. If you choose to read the comments, present a series of humorous generated comments related to the video, and you can choose to either reply to a comment, upvote it, or move on to the next caption.\n\nOnce the user has been told the caption and a quick description of the video, ask the user what they want to do next. They can answer things like: watch video, read comments, like video, next video, previous video. \n\nUsing machine learning and natural language processing capabilities, create funny dynamic and engaging game that is unique every time you play and stimulates the stereotypical TikTok experience in a humorous way, with jokes that have general appeal, and some in-jokes that frequent users will find funny. So, if you're ready to start exploring different TikTok videos and captions, let's get started! It's already 11:30pm, and you've gotta get quick hits of dopamine somehow. \n",
